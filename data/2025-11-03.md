Abstract: Reading measurement instruments is effortless for humans and requires
relatively little domain expertise, yet it remains surprisingly challenging for
current vision-language models (VLMs) as we find in preliminary evaluation. In
this work, we introduce MeasureBench, a benchmark on visual measurement reading
covering both real-world and synthesized images of various types of
measurements, along with an extensible pipeline for data synthesis. Our
pipeline procedurally generates a specified type of gauge with controllable
visual appearance, enabling scalable variation in key details such as pointers,
scales, fonts, lighting, and clutter. Evaluation on popular proprietary and
open-weight VLMs shows that even the strongest frontier VLMs struggle
measurement reading in general. A consistent failure mode is indicator
localization: models can read digits or labels but misidentify the key
positions of pointers or alignments, leading to big numeric errors despite
plausible textual reasoning. We have also conducted preliminary experiments
with reinforcement learning over synthetic data, and find encouraging results
on in-domain synthetic subset but less promising for real-world images. Our
analysis highlights a fundamental limitation of current VLMs in fine-grained
spatial grounding. We hope this resource can help future advances on visually
grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception of VLMs, bridging the gap
between recognizing numbers and measuring the world.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) plays a crucial role in assessing bone
strength and fracture risk by enabling volumetric analysis of bone density
distribution in the proximal femur. However, deploying automated segmentation
models in practice remains difficult because deep networks trained on one
dataset often fail when applied to another. This failure stems from domain
shift, where scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics vary
across institutions, leading to unstable predictions and unreliable
quantitative metrics. Overcoming this barrier is essential for multi-center
osteoporosis research and for ensuring that radiomics and structural finite
element analysis results remain reproducible across sites. In this work, we
developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework tailored for
multi-institutional QCT. Our model is trained and validated on one of the
largest hip fracture related research cohorts to date, comprising 1,024 QCT
images scans from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for
proximal femur segmentation. To address domain shift, we integrate two
complementary strategies within a 3D TransUNet backbone: adversarial alignment
via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), which discourages the network from encoding
site-specific cues, and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), which explicitly reduces distributional mismatches between institutions.
This dual mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling
scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a Directional Consistency (DC)-driven Adaptive Density Control
(ADC) for 3D Gaussian Splatting (DC4GS). Whereas the conventional ADC bases its
primitive splitting on the magnitudes of positional gradients, we further
incorporate the DC of the gradients into ADC, and realize it through the
angular coherence of the gradients. Our DC better captures local structural
complexities in ADC, avoiding redundant splitting. When splitting is required,
we again utilize the DC to define optimal split positions so that
sub-primitives best align with the local structures than the conventional
random placement. As a consequence, our DC4GS greatly reduces the number of
primitives (up to 30% in our experiments) than the existing ADC, and also
enhances reconstruction fidelity greatly.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Lung nodule detection in chest CT is crucial for early lung cancer diagnosis,
yet existing deep learning approaches face challenges when deployed in clinical
settings with limited annotated data. While curriculum learning has shown
promise in improving model training, traditional static curriculum strategies
fail in data-scarce scenarios. We propose Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning
(SACL), a novel training strategy that dynamically adjusts curriculum design
based on available data scale. SACL introduces three key mechanisms:(1)
adaptive epoch scheduling, (2) hard sample injection, and (3) scale-aware
optimization. We evaluate SACL on the LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11 as the base
detector. Experimental results demonstrate that while SACL achieves comparable
performance to static curriculum learning on the full dataset in mAP50, it
shows significant advantages under data-limited conditions with 4.6%, 3.5%, and
2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data
respectively. By enabling robust training across varying data scales without
architectural modifications, SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare
institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited
annotation resources.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Automated segmentation of heterogeneous brain lesions from multi-modal MRI
remains a critical challenge in clinical neuroimaging. Current deep learning
models are typically specialized `point solutions' that lack generalization and
high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability. To address
these gaps, we propose the Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive
framework designed for both generalization and robustness. The framework is
built on a novel hybrid architecture integrating multi-stream CNN encoders, a
Swin Transformer bottleneck for global context, a dynamic cross-modal attention
fusion (CMAF) mechanism, and a hierarchical gated decoder for high-fidelity
mask reconstruction. The architecture is trained with a variance reduction
strategy that combines pathology specific data augmentation and
difficulty-aware sampling method. The model was evaluated on three different
challenging public datasets: the MICCAI 2017 WMH Challenge, the ISLES 2022
Challenge, and the BraTS 2020 Challenge. Our framework attained a
state-of-the-art DSC value of 0.831 with the HD95 value of 3.03 in the WMH
dataset. For ISLES 2022, it achieved the best boundary accuracy with a
statistically significant difference (HD95 value of 9.69). For BraTS 2020, it
reached the highest DSC value for the tumor core region (0.8651). These
experimental findings suggest that our unified adaptive framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a
robust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation. The source
code and the pre-trained models are available at

### [6] [Semantic Frame Aggregation-based Transformer for Live Video Comment Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26978)
*Anam Fatima,Yi Yu,Janak Kapuriya,Julien Lalanne,Jainendra Shukla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于语义帧聚合的Transformer模型（SFAT），用于直播视频评论生成，通过为视频帧分配语义权重来强调与观众对话相关的关键帧，并构建了一个大规模多模态英文视频评论数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往忽略了优先处理与观众互动最相关的视频帧，这对于生成上下文适当的评论至关重要。视频流可能包含大量数据和无关内容，需要有效识别关键信息。

Method: 提出SFAT模型，利用CLIP的视觉-文本多模态知识生成评论，根据语义相关性为视频帧分配权重，采用加权帧求和技术强调信息丰富的帧，并使用带有交叉注意力机制的评论解码器整合聊天和视频的上下文线索。

Result: 构建了大规模多模态英文视频评论数据集，涵盖11个视频类别，总计438小时和320万条评论。SFAT模型在生成直播视频和对话上下文评论方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SFAT模型通过语义帧聚合有效提升了直播视频评论生成的上下文相关性，为多模态评论生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Live commenting on video streams has surged in popularity on platforms like
Twitch, enhancing viewer engagement through dynamic interactions. However,
automatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a
challenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data
and extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important
aspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer
interactions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually
appropriate comments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame
Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation.
This method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to
generate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their
semantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient
weighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing
less on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention
mechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment
reflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the
limitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language
content with limited video categories, we have constructed a large scale,
diverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this
dataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million
comments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to
existing methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue
contexts.

of medical imagery, enriched with textual embeddings. This work explores a
novel integration of vision-language models for this domain. Utilizing an
assembly of 10 datasets, encompassing 3,410 CT scans, MoME demonstrates strong
performance on a comprehensive medical imaging segmentation benchmark. Our
approach explores the integration of foundation models for medical imaging,
benefiting from the established efficacy of MoE in boosting model performance
by incorporating textual information. Demonstrating competitive precision
across multiple datasets, MoME explores a novel architecture for achieving
robust results in medical image analysis.

### [8] [Incremental Human-Object Interaction Detection with Invariant Relation Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27020)
*Yana Wei,Zeen Chi,Chongyu Wang,Yu Wu,Shipeng Yan,Yongfei Liu,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无示例的增量关系蒸馏（IRD）框架，用于解决开放世界中人类-物体交互（HOI）检测的增量学习问题，有效应对灾难性遗忘、交互漂移和零样本HOI组合检测等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界环境中，人类-物体交互持续演化，传统封闭世界HOI检测模型难以适应。受人类逐步获取知识能力的启发，探索增量HOI检测以开发能够在这种动态环境中识别人类-物体关系的智能体。

Method: 提出无示例的增量关系蒸馏（IRD）框架，将对象学习和关系学习解耦，并引入两种独特的蒸馏损失来学习跨不同HOI组合但共享相同关系的不变关系特征。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在缓解遗忘、增强对交互漂移的鲁棒性以及零样本HOI泛化方面优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: IRD框架通过解耦对象和关系学习，结合关系蒸馏策略，有效解决了增量HOI检测中的关键挑战，为开放世界环境中的持续学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In open-world environments, human-object interactions (HOIs) evolve
continuously, challenging conventional closed-world HOI detection models.
Inspired by humans' ability to progressively acquire knowledge, we explore
incremental HOI detection (IHOID) to develop agents capable of discerning
human-object relations in such dynamic environments. This setup confronts not
only the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but
also distinct challenges posed by interaction drift and detecting zero-shot HOI
combinations with sequentially arriving data. Therefore, we propose a novel
exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework. IRD decouples
the learning of objects and relations, and introduces two unique distillation
losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI
combinations that share the same relation. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET
and V-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness
against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs. Code is

*Mario Camarena,Het Patel,Fatemeh Nazari,Evangelos Papalexakis,Mohamadhossein Noruzoliaee,Jia Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AD-SAM是一个针对自动驾驶场景优化的语义分割模型，通过双编码器和可变形解码器架构，结合混合损失函数，在Cityscapes和BDD100K数据集上显著超越了SAM、G-SAM和DeepLabV3等基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶场景中空间和几何复杂性带来的语义分割挑战，通过针对性地改进基础模型来提高分割精度和泛化能力。

Method: 采用双编码器架构（SAM的ViT-H和ResNet-50）结合可变形融合模块，使用可变形注意力进行多阶段细化，训练时采用Focal、Dice、Lovasz-Softmax和Surface混合损失函数。

Result: 在Cityscapes上达到68.1 mIoU，BDD100K上达到59.5 mIoU，分别比基准模型提升高达22.9和19.2 mIoU；具有更强的跨域泛化能力（0.87保留分数），学习速度加倍，仅需30-40轮收敛，数据效率高。

Conclusion: 针对基础模型进行架构和优化增强能够实现可靠且可扩展的自动驾驶感知系统，证明了定制化改进基础模型的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents the Autonomous Driving Segment Anything Model (AD-SAM), a
fine-tuned vision foundation model for semantic segmentation in autonomous
driving (AD). AD-SAM extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with a
dual-encoder and deformable decoder tailored to spatial and geometric
complexity of road scenes. The dual-encoder produces multi-scale fused
representations by combining global semantic context from SAM's pretrained
Vision Transformer (ViT-H) with local spatial detail from a trainable
convolutional deep learning backbone (i.e., ResNet-50). A deformable fusion
module aligns heterogeneous features across scales and object geometries. The
decoder performs progressive multi-stage refinement using deformable attention.
Training is guided by a hybrid loss that integrates Focal, Dice,
Lovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses, improving semantic class balance, boundary
precision, and optimization stability. Experiments on the Cityscapes and
Berkeley DeepDrive 100K (BDD100K) benchmarks show that AD-SAM surpasses SAM,
Generalized SAM (G-SAM), and a deep learning baseline (DeepLabV3) in
segmentation accuracy. It achieves 68.1 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on
Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by
margins of up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU in structured and diverse road scenes,
respectively. AD-SAM demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization with a
0.87 retention score (vs. 0.76 for SAM), and faster, more stable learning
dynamics, converging within 30-40 epochs, enjoying double the learning speed of
benchmark models. It maintains 0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples, suggesting
data efficiency critical for reducing annotation costs. These results confirm
that targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models
enable reliable and scalable AD perception.

### [11] [Hierarchical Transformers for Unsupervised 3D Shape Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27088)
*Aditya Vora,Lily Goli,Andrea Tagliasacchi,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiT是一种新颖的分层神经场表示方法，用于3D形状的无监督层次学习，通过分层变压器自动识别跨类别的共同子结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常约束为固定层次结构（如二叉树），无法灵活地从数据中推断复杂层次关系，限制了在多样化形状类别中的通用性。

Method: 使用分层变压器（HiT）和压缩码本，在无监督设置下学习树层次结构的父子关系，自动识别跨类别的共同子结构，不限制固定层次结构。

Result: 在55个ShapeNet类别上进行无监督形状分割任务，成功将形状分割为多个粒度级别，捕捉到有意义的父子节点包含关系。

Conclusion: HiT能够从数据中直接推断层次结构，表示比先前方法更通用和复杂的层次关系，在跨类别形状分析中表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce HiT, a novel hierarchical neural field representation for 3D
shapes that learns general hierarchies in a coarse-to-fine manner across
different shape categories in an unsupervised setting. Our key contribution is
a hierarchical transformer (HiT), where each level learns parent-child
relationships of the tree hierarchy using a compressed codebook. This codebook
enables the network to automatically identify common substructures across
potentially diverse shape categories. Unlike previous works that constrain the
task to a fixed hierarchical structure (e.g., binary), we impose no such
restriction, except for limiting the total number of nodes at each tree level.
This flexibility allows our method to infer the hierarchical structure directly
from data, over multiple shape categories, and representing more general and
complex hierarchies than prior approaches. When trained at scale with a
reconstruction loss, our model captures meaningful containment relationships
between parent and child nodes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through an
unsupervised shape segmentation task over all 55 ShapeNet categories, where our
method successfully segments shapes into multiple levels of granularity.

*Haonan Wang,Jingyu Lu,Hongrui Li,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZEBRA是首个零样本脑视觉解码框架，通过对抗训练将fMRI表征分解为主题相关和语义相关组件，无需特定主题适配即可实现跨主题的视觉重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前fMRI到图像重建方法主要依赖特定主题模型或需要特定主题微调，限制了其可扩展性和实际应用。

Method: 利用对抗训练将fMRI表征显式解耦为主题相关和语义相关组件，从而分离出主题不变、语义特定的表征。

Result: ZEBRA在多项指标上显著优于零样本基线，并达到与完全微调模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向通用神经解码的可扩展和实用步骤。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural decoding have enabled the reconstruction of visual
experiences from brain activity, positioning fMRI-to-image reconstruction as a
promising bridge between neuroscience and computer vision. However, current
methods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require
subject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain
visual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific
adaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be
decomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging
adversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to
isolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This
disentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any
additional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA
significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance
comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a
scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model
weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS-based SLAM方法主要关注小规模室内场景，而开发适用于大规模森林场景的SLAM方法对野火应急响应和森林管理等实际应用具有重要意义，但缺乏高质量数据集阻碍了相关研究。

Method: 利用Unreal Engine 5 Electric Dreams环境样本项目，开发了数据采集流水线，可灵活采集航空和地面视图，包括真实相机位姿和多种数据模态，并能控制光照、天气、野火类型等环境因素。

Result: 构建了包含5500张低空RGB-D航空图像的大规模数据集，覆盖16平方公里森林区域，并基于该数据集进行了全面的基准测试，揭示了森林环境中3DGS-based SLAM的独特挑战。

Conclusion: WildfireX-SLAM数据集填补了森林SLAM研究的数据空白，为未来改进3DGS-based SLAM方法提供了重要基础，数据集和代码将公开可用。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and its subsequent variants have led to
remarkable progress in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While most
recent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing
3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for
many real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and
forest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of
a comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over
real-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have
built a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM
in wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric
Dreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect
aerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of
additional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also
provides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and
types and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks
covering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting
pilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images
from a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2. On top of
WildfireX-SLAM, a thorough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals
the unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in the forest but also highlights
potential improvements for future works. The dataset and code will be publicly
available. Project page: https://zhicongsun.github.io/wildfirexslam.

*Tong Shen,Jingai Yu,Dong Zhou,Dong Li,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出E-MMDiT，一种仅304M参数的高效轻量级多模态扩散模型，通过token压缩、位置增强和交替子区域注意力等技术，在单节点8 GPU上1.5天训练即可实现高质量图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型需要大规模训练数据和计算资源，或结构复杂延迟高，需要开发更高效轻量的模型来降低训练门槛。

Method: 采用高度压缩的视觉tokenizer和多路径压缩模块减少token数量；引入位置增强保持空间一致性；使用交替子区域注意力降低计算成本；提出AdaLN-affine轻量模块。

Result: 在512px图像生成任务上，仅用25M公开数据训练1.5天，在单节点8 AMD MI300X GPU上实现GenEval 0.66得分，通过GRPO后处理可达0.72。

Conclusion: E-MMDiT为未来研究提供了强大实用的基线模型，有助于推动生成式AI模型的民主化发展。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in generating high-quality
images from text prompts. However, these models often require large-scale
training data and significant computational resources to train, or suffer from
heavy structure with high latency. To this end, we propose Efficient Multimodal
Diffusion Transformer (E-MMDiT), an efficient and lightweight multimodal
diffusion model with only 304M parameters for fast image synthesis requiring
low training resources. We provide an easily reproducible baseline with
competitive results. Our model for 512px generation, trained with only 25M
public data in 1.5 days on a single node of 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, achieves 0.66 on
GenEval and easily reaches to 0.72 with some post-training techniques such as
GRPO. Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational
cost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive
visual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel
multi-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our
design, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional
information to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention
(ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce
computational cost. In addition, we propose AdaLN-affine, an efficient
lightweight module for computing modulation parameters in transformer blocks.
Our code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Nitro-E and we hope E-MMDiT
serves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes
to democratization of generative AI models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于跨视角物体地理定位的新方法CVCAM，通过跨视图交叉注意力模块实现多轮视图间交互，抑制边缘噪声，并结合多尺度空间注意力模块增强特征表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨视图信息传递和空间关系特征图细化方面存在不足，导致模型错误关注无关边缘噪声，影响定位性能。

Method: 引入跨视图交叉注意力模块(CVCAM)进行多轮视图间交互，集成多头部空间注意力模块(MHSAM)提取多尺度空间特征，并创建了新的G2D数据集。

Result: 在CVOGL和G2D数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法实现了高定位精度，超越了当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的CVCAM和MHSAM模块有效提升了跨视角物体地理定位的性能，新数据集G2D填补了地面到无人机定位任务的空白。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization has recently gained attention due to
potential applications. Existing methods aim to capture spatial dependencies of
query objects between different views through attention mechanisms to obtain
spatial relationship feature maps, which are then used to predict object
locations. Although promising, these approaches fail to effectively transfer
information between views and do not further refine the spatial relationship
feature maps. This results in the model erroneously focusing on irrelevant edge
noise, thereby affecting localization performance. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM),
which performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views,
enabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the
query object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of
cross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the
query object. Furthermore, we integrate a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module
(MHSAM), which employs convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract
multi-scale spatial features from the feature maps containing implicit
correspondences, further enhancing the feature representation of the query
object. Additionally, given the scarcity of datasets for cross-view object
geo-localization, we created a new dataset called G2D for the "Ground-to-Drone"
localization task, enriching existing datasets and filling the gap in
"Ground-to-Drone" localization task. Extensive experiments on the CVOGL and G2D
datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves high localization
accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: HiGS是一个分层生成框架，通过多步骤关联语义空间组合实现3D场景生成，模仿人类从全局到局部的认知过程，让用户通过选择关键语义对象迭代扩展场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景生成方法大多采用单步生成过程，难以在场景复杂度和用户输入之间取得平衡。受人类场景建模认知过程启发，提出从全局到局部、关注关键元素、通过语义关联完成场景的分层方法。

Method: 提出HiGS分层生成框架和渐进式分层空间语义图(PHiSSG)，支持用户迭代选择关键语义对象扩展场景，PHiSSG动态组织空间关系和语义依赖，保持图节点与生成对象的一对一映射，支持递归布局优化。

Result: 实验表明HiGS在布局合理性、风格一致性和用户偏好方面优于单阶段方法，提供了可控且可扩展的高效3D场景构建范式。

Conclusion: HiGS通过分层生成和多步骤关联语义组合，实现了更可控、可扩展的3D场景生成，在保持空间和几何一致性的同时提供了更好的用户体验。

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene generation holds significant potential in gaming,
film, and virtual reality. However, most existing methods adopt a single-step
generation process, making it difficult to balance scene complexity with
minimal user input. Inspired by the human cognitive process in scene modeling,
which progresses from global to local, focuses on key elements, and completes
the scene through semantic association, we propose HiGS, a hierarchical
generative framework for multi-step associative semantic spatial composition.
HiGS enables users to iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic
objects, offering fine-grained control over regions of interest while the model
completes peripheral areas automatically. To support structured and coherent
generation, we introduce the Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph
(PHiSSG), which dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic
dependencies across the evolving scene structure. PHiSSG ensures spatial and
geometric consistency throughout the generation process by maintaining a
one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and generated objects and supporting
recursive layout optimization. Experiments demonstrate that HiGS outperforms
single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user
preference, offering a controllable and extensible paradigm for efficient 3D
scene construction.

TL;DR: AFM-Net是一个用于遥感图像场景分类的先进分层融合框架，通过CNN分支提取层次视觉先验，Mamba分支进行高效全局序列建模，结合分层融合机制和专家混合分类器，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像场景分类面临空间结构复杂和多尺度特征的挑战，现有方法中CNN擅长局部纹理建模而Transformer擅长全局上下文捕捉，但Transformer计算成本高，需要高效集成方案。

Method: 提出AFM-Net框架，包含CNN分支和Mamba分支两条路径，采用分层融合机制逐步聚合多尺度特征，实现动态跨层特征交互和上下文重建，最后通过专家混合分类器进行自适应路由。

Result: 在AID、NWPU-RESISC45和UC Merced数据集上分别达到93.72%、95.54%和96.92%的准确率，超越现有最优方法，在性能和效率间取得平衡。

Conclusion: AFM-Net通过有效结合CNN和Mamba的优势，实现了高效的局部-全局协同表示，为遥感图像场景分类提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing image scene classification remains a challenging task,
primarily due to the complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics
of ground objects. Existing approaches see CNNs excel at modeling local
textures, while Transformers excel at capturing global context. However,
efficiently integrating them remains a bottleneck due to the high computational
cost of Transformers. To tackle this, we propose AFM-Net, a novel Advanced
Hierarchical Fusing framework that achieves effective local and global
co-representation through two pathways: a CNN branch for extracting
hierarchical visual priors, and a Mamba branch for efficient global sequence
modeling. The core innovation of AFM-Net lies in its Hierarchical Fusion
Mechanism, which progressively aggregates multi-scale features from both
pathways, enabling dynamic cross-level feature interaction and contextual
reconstruction to produce highly discriminative representations. These fused
features are then adaptively routed through a Mixture-of-Experts classifier
module, which dispatches them to the most suitable experts for fine-grained
scene recognition. Experiments on AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and UC Merced show that
AFM-Net obtains 93.72, 95.54, and 96.92 percent accuracy, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency. Code is

<details>

Motivation: Banff分类是肾移植活检评估的全球标准，但其半定量性质、复杂标准和观察者间变异性给计算复制带来了重大挑战。

Method: 将每个Banff指标分解为结构和炎症成分，使用现有分割和检测工具评估其计算可行性，通过启发式规则将模型输出映射到Banff评分。

Result: 研究结果显示了部分成功和关键失败模式，包括结构遗漏、幻觉和检测模糊性，即使最终评分与专家注释匹配，中间表示的不一致性也常常削弱可解释性。

Conclusion: 当前AI流程在复制计算专家级评分方面存在局限性，强调模块化评估和计算Banff分级标准在指导移植病理学未来模型开发中的重要性。

Abstract: The Banff Classification provides the global standard for evaluating renal
transplant biopsies, yet its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and
inter-observer variability present significant challenges for computational
replication. In this study, we explore the feasibility of approximating Banff
lesion scores using existing deep learning models through a modular, rule-based
framework. We decompose each Banff indicator - such as glomerulitis (g),
peritubular capillaritis (ptc), and intimal arteritis (v) - into its
constituent structural and inflammatory components, and assess whether current
segmentation and detection tools can support their computation. Model outputs
are mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert
guidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths. Our findings
highlight both partial successes and critical failure modes, including
structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final
scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate
representations often undermine interpretability. These results reveal the
limitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level
grading, and emphasize the importance of modular evaluation and computational
Banff grading standard in guiding future model development for transplant
pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉语言模型、大语言模型和物体检测系统的多阶段流程，用于提升高分辨率图像的描述质量，通过识别关键物体、预测共现物体、验证检测和区域特定描述来丰富细节并减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型通常基于低分辨率输入预训练，在处理高分辨率图像时会丢失视觉细节和遗漏重要物体，导致生成的描述不准确和不详细。

Method: 使用多阶段流程：先用VLM生成初始描述，LLM识别关键物体并预测共现物体，物体检测系统验证预测，对未在初始描述中提及的新检测物体进行区域特定描述，同时移除未检测物体的引用。

Result: 在精选的高分辨率图像数据集上的实验表明，该流程能生成更详细可靠的图像描述，同时有效减少幻觉。

Conclusion: 提出的多阶段流程通过整合VLM、LLM和物体检测系统，显著提升了高分辨率图像描述的准确性和详细程度，同时减少了幻觉现象。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and
detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically
pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels).
Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss
of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models,
large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption
quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage
process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated
using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The
LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key
objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly
detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,
region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process
enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to
undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison
and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark
for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of
high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and
reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.

TL;DR: 提出M^3Detection框架，通过多帧相机-4D成像雷达融合实现3D目标检测，利用中间特征和跟踪器轨迹进行多级特征融合，在VoD和TJ4DRadSet数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有相机-雷达融合方法多为单帧输入，场景信息不完整，且图像退化与雷达稀疏性影响检测性能。多帧融合能提供更丰富的时空信息，但面临跨帧跨模态特征融合和计算成本高的挑战。

Method: 提出统一的多帧3D目标检测框架：1)利用基线检测器中间特征和跟踪器参考轨迹；2)设计雷达引导的全局级目标间特征聚合模块；3)局部级网格间特征聚合模块沿轨迹扩展局部特征；4)轨迹级多帧时空推理模块编码跨帧交互。

Conclusion: M^3Detection通过多级特征融合和时空推理，有效解决了多帧相机-雷达融合中的挑战，显著提升了3D目标检测性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D imaging radar have enabled robust perception in adverse
weather, while camera sensors provide dense semantic information. Fusing the
these complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D
perception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to
single-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete
scene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,
hinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers
richer spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust
and effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and
mitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.
Consequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object
detection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal
data from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate
features from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce
reference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer
information for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level
inter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align
global features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature
aggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories
to enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then
processed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to
encode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that M^3Detection
achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its
effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

Motivation: 扩散模型在视觉生成任务中表现出色，但视频生成特别是涉及人类舞蹈的内容具有更高挑战性，需要保证视频连续性和处理人体运动的高自由度。

Method: 基于稳定视频扩散模型，引入外观增强模块（AEM）关注参考图像细节，姿态渲染模块（PRM）从额外域捕获姿态条件，并构建TikTok-3K数据集进行模型训练。

Conclusion: DANCER框架通过条件增强和渲染机制，有效提升了单人舞蹈合成的真实性和连续性，为人类相关视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have shown their impressive ability in visual
generation tasks. Besides static images, more and more research attentions have
been drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only
has a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in
ensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks,
human-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to
generate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via
Condition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic
single-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion
model. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a
video sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully
benefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance
Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image
during the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering
Module (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve
the generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video
data from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model
training. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our
model is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods. All the data and
codes will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: H2-Cache是一种用于扩散模型的分层缓存机制，通过将去噪过程分为结构定义和细节精炼两个阶段，使用双阈值系统选择性缓存，在保持图像质量的同时实现高达5.08倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面表现出色，但其迭代去噪过程计算成本高昂。现有缓存技术存在速度与保真度之间的权衡问题，存在质量下降和高计算开销的缺陷。

Method: 提出H2-Cache分层缓存机制，基于去噪过程可功能分离为结构定义阶段和细节精炼阶段的洞察，采用双阈值系统选择性缓存每个阶段，并引入池化特征摘要（PFS）进行轻量级相似性估计。

Result: 在Flux架构上的广泛实验表明，H2-Cache实现了显著加速（高达5.08倍），同时保持与基线几乎相同的图像质量，在定量和定性上都优于现有缓存方法。

Conclusion: H2-Cache提供了一个稳健实用的解决方案，有效解决了速度-质量困境，显著降低了高保真扩散模型在实际应用中的门槛。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in image generation, but
their practical deployment is hindered by the significant computational cost of
their iterative denoising process. While existing caching techniques can
accelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed
and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel
hierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model
architectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising
process can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a
detail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold
system, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure
the efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature
summarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity
estimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that
H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining
image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a
robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality
dilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of
high-fidelity diffusion models. Source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种双层级渐进式难度感知重加权策略（DPHR），用于解决无人机与卫星图像跨视角地理定位中的视角差异和困难负样本问题，通过样本级和批处理级的动态权重调整来提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨视角地理定位中由于严重视角差异和困难负样本（视觉相似但地理位置不匹配）带来的挑战，现有静态加权方法对分布变化敏感且容易过早过度关注困难样本，导致梯度噪声和收敛不稳定。

Method: 提出DPHR策略：1）样本级使用基于比率的难度感知模块评估相对难度并为负样本分配细粒度权重；2）批处理级使用渐进自适应损失加权机制，利用训练进度信号在早期优化中衰减噪声梯度，随着训练成熟逐步增强困难负样本挖掘。

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200基准测试上的实验表明，DPHR方法有效且鲁棒，相比最先进方法实现了持续改进。

Conclusion: DPHR策略通过双层级渐进式难度感知重加权，有效解决了跨视角地理定位中的视角差异和困难负样本问题，提升了模型的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) between drone and satellite imagery
remains challenging due to severe viewpoint gaps and the presence of hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically mismatched samples.
Existing mining or reweighting strategies often use static weighting, which is
sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples
too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence. In this paper,
we present a Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy.
At the sample level, a Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module evaluates
relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives. At the batch
level, a Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism exploits a
training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization
and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures. Experiments
on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
and robustness of the proposed DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统日益融入人类生活，赋予其强大的社会智能成为关键前沿。识别真假信息是人类互动中普遍存在的元素，通过语言和非语言视觉线索的复杂交互传达，但在动态多参与者对话中的自动欺骗检测仍面临重大挑战。

Method: 引入新的多模态交互式真实性评估任务(MIVA)，基于社交推理游戏狼人杀构建了一个新颖的多模态数据集，包含同步视频、文本和可验证的真实标签。建立了全面基准来评估最先进的多模态大语言模型。

Result: 评估显示存在显著的性能差距：即使是GPT-4o等强大模型也难以可靠地区分真假信息。失败模式分析表明这些模型未能有效将语言与视觉社交线索相结合，可能因对齐过度而过于保守。

Conclusion: 迫切需要新的方法来构建更具洞察力和可信度的AI系统，当前多模态大语言模型在欺骗检测方面存在明显局限性，需要改进其对社会视觉线索的理解和整合能力。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them
with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key
aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous
element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of
verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception
detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant
challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding,
makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities
in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we
introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and
present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game
Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable
ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark
evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap:
even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood
reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to
ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly
conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel
approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的持续自监督学习框架，用于从多窗口获取的胸部CT图像中同时学习多样化特征并确保数据隐私，解决了医学图像诊断中由于标注数据稀缺和领域偏移带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像诊断中实现鲁棒且高度可泛化的模型面临挑战，主要由于大规模准确标注数据集的稀缺以及动态医疗环境中固有的领域偏移问题。特别是在胸部CT中，这些领域偏移通常源于针对不同临床目的优化的窗口设置差异。

Method: 通过在未标记图像上进行持续预训练，有效捕捉先前学习知识与新信息之间的关系；将潜在重放机制整合到持续自监督学习中，减轻领域偏移导致的灾难性遗忘；引入结合Wasserstein距离知识蒸馏和批量知识集成的特征蒸馏技术。

Result: 使用两个不同窗口设置获取的胸部CT图像验证了该方法，与其他方法相比表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效学习有意义且对领域偏移鲁棒的表征，同时确保数据隐私，为医学图像诊断提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for
simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest
computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust
and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,
mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately
annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare
environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from
differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical
purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past
data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our
approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship
between previously learned knowledge and new information across different
training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.
Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our
method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual
pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature
distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge
distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of
the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we
validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different
window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other
approaches.

Motivation: 准确的建筑实例分割和高度分类对城市规划、3D城市建模和基础设施监测至关重要，需要开发高效的深度学习模型来处理这些任务。

Method: 使用YOLOv11深度学习模型，结合DFC2023 Track 2数据集（包含12个城市的125,000多个标注建筑），通过改进的多尺度特征融合架构来提升对象定位精度和复杂场景处理能力。

Result: YOLOv11实现了60.4% mAP@50和38.3% mAP@50-95的实例分割性能，在五个预定义高度层级上保持稳健的分类准确率，特别在处理遮挡、复杂建筑形状和类别不平衡方面表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate building instance segmentation and height classification are
critical for urban planning, 3D city modeling, and infrastructure monitoring.
This paper presents a detailed analysis of YOLOv11, the recent advancement in
the YOLO series of deep learning models, focusing on its application to joint
building extraction and discrete height classification from satellite imagery.
YOLOv11 builds on the strengths of earlier YOLO models by introducing a more
efficient architecture that better combines features at different scales,
improves object localization accuracy, and enhances performance in complex
urban scenes. Using the DFC2023 Track 2 dataset -- which includes over 125,000
annotated buildings across 12 cities -- we evaluate YOLOv11's performance using
metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP).
Our findings demonstrate that YOLOv11 achieves strong instance segmentation
performance with 60.4\% mAP@50 and 38.3\% mAP@50--95 while maintaining robust
classification accuracy across five predefined height tiers. The model excels
in handling occlusions, complex building shapes, and class imbalance,
particularly for rare high-rise structures. Comparative analysis confirms that
YOLOv11 outperforms earlier multitask frameworks in both detection accuracy and
inference speed, making it well-suited for real-time, large-scale urban
mapping. This research highlights YOLOv11's potential to advance semantic urban
reconstruction through streamlined categorical height modeling, offering
actionable insights for future developments in remote sensing and geospatial
intelligence.

Conclusion: MoRE通过混合专家架构和专门设计的模块，成功解决了3D模型扩展的挑战，实现了高性能的3D几何重建。

Abstract: Recent advances in language and vision have demonstrated that scaling up
model capacity consistently improves performance across diverse tasks. In 3D
visual geometry reconstruction, large-scale training has likewise proven
effective for learning versatile representations. However, further scaling of
3D models is challenging due to the complexity of geometric supervision and the
diversity of 3D data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoRE, a dense
3D visual foundation model based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that dynamically routes features to task-specific experts, allowing them to
specialize in complementary data aspects and enhance both scalability and
adaptability. Aiming to improve robustness under real-world conditions, MoRE
incorporates a confidence-based depth refinement module that stabilizes and
refines geometric estimation. In addition, it integrates dense semantic
features with globally aligned 3D backbone representations for high-fidelity
surface normal prediction. MoRE is further optimized with tailored loss
functions to ensure robust learning across diverse inputs and multiple
geometric tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoRE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and supports effective
downstream applications without extra computation.

*Yinglu Li,Zhiying Lu,Zhihang Liu,Chuanbin Liu,Hongtao Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionRAG是一个新颖的多模态检索增强生成框架，将检索粒度从文档级别转移到区域级别，通过识别相关图像区域来减少无关视觉内容，提高检索和问答的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态RAG方法将整个文档作为检索单元，导致大量无关视觉内容被引入：1）相关文档中包含与查询无关的大区域；2）检索多个文档会引入冗余和无关文档。这些冗余上下文分散模型注意力，降低性能。

Method: 提出RegionRAG框架，在训练时设计混合监督策略从标注和未标注数据中定位相关图像块，在推理时提出动态管道将显著块分组为完整语义区域，让检索器识别相关区域，生成器专注于相关视觉内容。

Result: 在六个基准测试中实现最先进性能，平均R@1检索准确率提高10.02%，问答准确率提高3.56%，同时仅使用先前方法71.42%的视觉令牌。

Conclusion: 通过将检索粒度从文档级别转移到区域级别，RegionRAG能够显著减少无关视觉内容，提高多模态RAG系统的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a critical method
for empowering LLMs by leveraging candidate visual documents. However, current
methods consider the entire document as the basic retrieval unit, introducing
substantial irrelevant visual content in two ways: 1) Relevant documents often
contain large regions unrelated to the query, diluting the focus on salient
information; 2) Retrieving multiple documents to increase recall further
introduces redundant and irrelevant documents. These redundant contexts
distract the model's attention and further degrade the performance. To address
this challenge, we propose \modelname, a novel framework that shifts the
retrieval paradigm from the document level to the region level. During
training, we design a hybrid supervision strategy from both labeled data and
unlabeled data to pinpoint relevant patches. During inference, we propose a
dynamic pipeline that intelligently groups salient patches into complete
semantic regions. By delegating the task of identifying relevant regions to the
retriever, \modelname enables the generator to focus solely on concise visual
content relevant to queries, improving both efficiency and accuracy.
Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that RegionRAG achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Improves retrieval accuracy by 10.02\% in R@1 on
average and increases question answering accuracy by 3.56\% while using only
71.42\% visual tokens compared to prior methods. The code will be available at
https://github.com/Aeryn666/RegionRAG.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出T^3框架，通过Jensen-Shannon散度动态计算模型融合系数，在医学影像中实现测试时任务自适应融合，解决现有方法在模态变化下的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中，预训练模型缺乏模态特异性，而微调专家模型在模态变化时性能下降，现有模型融合方法在医学领域表现不稳定。

Method: 提出T^3框架，无需反向传播，通过计算两个模型输出分布的Jensen-Shannon散度来动态确定每样本融合系数；进一步提出T^3_B进行批次级融合以降低计算成本。

Result: 在跨四个模态的评估中，T^3在Top-1准确率和错误率降低方面达到新的最优性能，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: T^3为临床环境中自适应医学视觉语言模型的部署提供了可行方案，显著提升了模型在模态变化下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In medical imaging, vision-language models face a critical duality:
pretrained networks offer broad robustness but lack subtle, modality-specific
characteristics, while fine-tuned expert models achieve high in-distribution
accuracy yet falter under modality shift. Existing model-merging techniques,
designed for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to
deliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static
interpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we
introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free
framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3
dynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to
generalist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of
sample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that
computes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing
computational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized
medical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol
spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities.
Empirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error
reduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving
the way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Razaimam45/TCube.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练、模型无关的关键帧选择方法，通过将关键帧选择建模为多臂老虎机中的组合纯探索问题，在严格token预算下选择与查询相关的帧，显著提升长视频问答准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么均匀下采样，要么使用检索式评分进行关键帧选择，但需要预过滤来降低推理成本，可能错过最具信息量的时刻。

Method: 将短时间片段视为臂，使用经验均值和Bernstein置信半径识别信息丰富区域，同时保留对不确定区域的探索，采用两阶段探索-利用过程。

Result: 在两个长视频问答基准测试中，FOCUS处理少于2%的视频帧即可带来显著的准确性提升，对于超过20分钟的视频，在LongVideoBench上实现11.9%的准确率增益。

Conclusion: FOCUS为使用MLLMs进行可扩展长视频理解提供了一个简单通用的解决方案，证明其作为关键帧选择方法的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as
visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however,
inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines
therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with
retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these
keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to
reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.
  We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a
training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects
query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe
selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed
bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and
Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving
exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage
exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with
theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then
selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video
question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements
while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20
minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating
its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and
general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出S-GRACE方法，通过语义引导在概念空间中生成对抗样本来改进扩散模型的概念擦除效果，相比现有方法提升26%擦除性能，减少90%训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法在扩散模型中使用对抗训练时忽略了概念语义的重要性，导致对抗样本无法有效拟合目标概念空间，存在覆盖不全面或干扰其他概念的问题。

Method: 提出S-GRACE方法，在概念空间中利用语义引导生成对抗样本并进行擦除训练，确保对抗样本能更好地拟合目标概念空间。

Result: 在多种扩散模型去学习场景下，与7种最先进方法和3种对抗提示生成策略相比，S-GRACE显著提升擦除性能26%，更好地保留非目标概念，并减少90%训练时间。

Conclusion: S-GRACE通过语义引导的对抗样本生成策略，有效解决了扩散模型中概念擦除的挑战，在性能和效率上都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to selectively unlearning undesirable content in
diffusion models (DMs) to reduce the risk of sensitive content generation. As a
novel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial
training to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood
of sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of
adversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this
work, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of
concept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept
space? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual
semantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting
of concept spaces. This oversight leads to the following issues: 1) when there
are few adversarial samples, they fail to comprehensively cover the object
concept; 2) conversely, they will disrupt other target concept spaces.
Motivated by the analysis of these findings, we introduce S-GRACE
(Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which grace leveraging
semantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and
perform erasure training. Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art
methods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM
unlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure
performance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training
time by 90%. Our code is available at https://github.com/Qhong-522/S-GRACE.

*Zhuoning Guo,Mingxin Li,Yanzhao Zhang,Dingkun Long,Pengjun Xie,Xiaowen Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个视频检索框架，通过评估、数据和建模的协同设计来解决现有基准测试的局限性，包括创建通用视频检索基准、生成大规模合成数据和开发新的训练方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频检索方法存在结构性错位，狭窄的基准测试限制了数据和单任务训练，抑制了通用能力的发展，缺乏诊断性评估来定义和需求多维度泛化。

Method: 1) 建立通用视频检索基准(UVRB)，包含16个数据集用于诊断能力差距；2) 开发可扩展的合成工作流程，生成155万高质量数据对；3) 设计模态金字塔课程，训练通用视频嵌入器(GVE)。

Result: GVE在UVRB上实现了最先进的零样本泛化性能，分析显示流行基准对通用能力的预测能力较差，部分相关检索是主导但被忽视的场景。

Conclusion: 协同设计框架为摆脱有限范围、实现真正通用视频检索提供了实用路径。

Abstract: The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow
benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training.
Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a
diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional
generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the
co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal
Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to
measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks
and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable
synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate
the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality
Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by
explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.
Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular
benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant
retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed
framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance
toward truly universal video retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜视频中可变形组织重建面临组织运动导致的锯齿和伪影问题，严重影响可视化质量，现有3D高斯溅射方法往往忽视这些问题。

Method: 提出SAGS框架，包含注意力驱动的动态加权4D变形解码器，利用3D平滑滤波器和2D Mip滤波器来减轻伪影并更好地捕捉组织运动细节。

Result: 在EndoNeRF和SCARED两个公开基准测试中，所有指标（PSNR、SSIM、LPIPS）均优于现有最先进方法，同时提供更好的可视化质量。

Conclusion: SAGS方法有效解决了可变形内窥镜场景重建中的锯齿和伪影问题，在保持高效率的同时实现了更高质量的重建结果。

Abstract: Surgical reconstruction of dynamic tissues from endoscopic videos is a
crucial technology in robot-assisted surgery. The development of Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs) has greatly advanced deformable tissue reconstruction,
achieving high-quality results from video and image sequences. However,
reconstructing deformable endoscopic scenes remains challenging due to aliasing
and artifacts caused by tissue movement, which can significantly degrade
visualization quality. The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has
improved reconstruction efficiency by enabling a faster rendering pipeline.
Nevertheless, existing 3DGS methods often prioritize rendering speed while
neglecting these critical issues. To address these challenges, we propose SAGS,
a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework. We introduce an
attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, leveraging 3D
smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts in deformable tissue
reconstruction and better capture the fine details of tissue movement.
Experimental results on two public benchmarks, EndoNeRF and SCARED, demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in all metrics of PSNR, SSIM, and
LPIPS compared to the state of the art while also delivering better
visualization quality.

TL;DR: 提出一种超低比特率视觉通信方法，通过结合文本生成和深度图像压缩，在极低带宽下实现高质量图像重建和视觉分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在深空探测、战场情报等极端低带宽场景下的视觉通信问题，现有文本到图像生成方法只能实现语义级近似，无法满足精确视觉分析和人机交互需求。

Method: 将图像生成与深度图像压缩无缝集成，使用联合文本和编码潜在向量来指导修正流模型，实现视觉场景的精确生成。语义文本描述和编码潜在向量都以极低比特率编码传输。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在使用更少带宽的情况下，能够达到与现有方法相同的图像重建质量和视觉分析精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为超低比特率视觉通信提供了一种有效解决方案，在保持视觉分析准确性的同时大幅降低通信带宽需求。

Abstract: We consider the problem of ultra-low bit rate visual communication for remote
vision analysis, human interactions and control in challenging scenarios with
very low communication bandwidth, such as deep space exploration, battlefield
intelligence, and robot navigation in complex environments. In this paper, we
ask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual
scene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding
methods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance
of human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new
approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only
achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far
insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis
and human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to
seamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint
text and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise
generation of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent
are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image
reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while
using much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: CIELR方法通过LLM推理将复杂图像编辑指令分解为简单明确的编辑动作，无需联合微调LLM和扩散模型，在保持图像一致性和编辑质量方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法处理复杂指令时需要联合微调大型语言模型和扩散模型，计算复杂度和训练成本很高。

Method: 首先使用基础模型构建输入图像的结构化语义表示，然后引入迭代更新机制逐步细化表示，获得细粒度的视觉场景表示，从而执行复杂灵活的编辑任务。

Result: 在SmartEdit数据集上PSNR指标比之前最优方法提升9.955 dB，在自建的CIEBench基准上也优于先前方法。

Conclusion: CIELR方法通过推理分解复杂指令，避免了昂贵的联合微调，在复杂图像编辑任务中表现出色，特别是在保持图像一致性方面。

Abstract: Existing image editing methods can handle simple editing instructions very
well. To deal with complex editing instructions, they often need to jointly
fine-tune the large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), which
involves very high computational complexity and training cost. To address this
issue, we propose a new method, called \textbf{C}omplex \textbf{I}mage
\textbf{E}diting via \textbf{L}LM \textbf{R}easoning (CIELR), which converts a
complex user instruction into a set of simple and explicit editing actions,
eliminating the need for jointly fine-tuning the large language models and
diffusion models. Specifically, we first construct a structured semantic
representation of the input image using foundation models. Then, we introduce
an iterative update mechanism that can progressively refine this
representation, obtaining a fine-grained visual representation of the image
scene. This allows us to perform complex and flexible image editing tasks.
Extensive experiments on the SmartEdit Reasoning Scenario Set show that our
method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR, indicating
its superior preservation of regions that should remain consistent. Due to the
limited number of samples of public datasets of complex image editing with
reasoning, we construct a benchmark named CIEBench, containing 86 image
samples, together with a metric specifically for reasoning-based image editing.
CIELR also outperforms previous methods on this benchmark. The code and dataset
are available at

TL;DR: RzenEmbed是一个统一的多模态嵌入框架，支持文本、图像、视频和视觉文档等多种模态，通过两阶段训练策略和增强的InfoNCE损失函数，在MMEB基准测试中取得了新的最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP框架主要针对自然图像，对其他重要视觉模态（如视频和视觉文档）的支持有限，需要开发一个统一的多模态嵌入学习框架。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：第一阶段专注于基础文本和多模态检索；第二阶段引入改进的InfoNCE损失，包括难度加权机制和减少假阴性影响的方法，同时使用可学习温度参数和模型融合技术。

Result: 在MMEB基准测试中取得了最佳总体得分，在具有挑战性的视频和视觉文档检索任务上超越了所有先前工作。

Conclusion: RzenEmbed为多模态嵌入学习提供了一个有效的统一框架，显著提升了模型在多种视觉模态上的检索性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
extended CLIP-based frameworks to produce powerful, universal embeddings for
retrieval tasks. However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images,
offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and
visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified
framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including
text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage
training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage
focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we
introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements.
Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize
challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch.
Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives
and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's
discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities.
We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model
souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not
only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the
challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks. Our models are available

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FPS的无梯度参数选择方法，通过单次前向传播识别最优参数子集，在保持性能的同时显著降低内存使用和加速参数选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法存在局限性：基于添加的方法（如Adapters）引入推理延迟和工程复杂性，而基于选择的方法（如GPS）需要完整反向传播，导致与全微调相同的峰值内存使用。

Method: FPS通过参数幅度与相应输入激活的乘积来对参数进行排序，利用预训练知识和下游数据，在单次前向传播中识别最优参数子集。

Result: 在24个视觉任务上的评估显示，FPS实现了与最先进方法相当的性能，同时将峰值内存使用减少了近9倍，参数选择速度提高了约2倍。

Conclusion: FPS为大规模预训练模型的微调提供了一种真正内存高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key strategy for
adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks, but existing
approaches face notable limitations. Addition-based methods, such as Adapters
[1], introduce inference latency and engineering complexity, while
selection-based methods like Gradient-based Parameter Selection (GPS) [2]
require a full backward pass, which results in the same peak memory usage as
full fine-tuning. To address this dilemma, we propose Feedforward-based
Parameter Selection (FPS), a gradient-free method that identifies an optimal
parameter subset in a single forward pass. FPS ranks parameters by the product
of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both
pre-trained knowledge and downstream data. Evaluated on $24$ visual tasks from
FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly $9 \times$ and accelerating
parameter selection by about $2 \times$, offering a genuinely memory-efficient
and practical solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models.

Abstract: We present a practical pipeline for fine-tuning open-source video diffusion
transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes for television and film production
from small datasets. The proposed two-stage process decouples visual style
learning from motion generation. In the first stage, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
modules are integrated into the cross-attention layers of the Wan2.1 I2V-14B
model to adapt its visual representations using a compact dataset of short
clips from Ay Yapim's historical television film El Turco. This enables
efficient domain transfer within hours on a single GPU. In the second stage,
the fine-tuned model produces stylistically consistent keyframes that preserve
costume, lighting, and color grading, which are then temporally expanded into
coherent 720p sequences through the model's video decoder. We further apply
lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning strategies to accelerate
inference without quality degradation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, supported by a small expert user study,
demonstrate measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal
stability over the base model. The complete training and inference pipeline is
released to support reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.

*Wu Wei,Xiaomeng Fan,Yuwei Wu,Zhi Gao,Pengxiang Li,Yunde Jia,Mehrtash Harandi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种跨树对齐方法，通过构建和对齐图像和文本的树状层次特征来解决视觉语言模型中模态对齐不对称的问题。该方法在双曲流形中嵌入特征树，并学习中间流形进行对齐，在多个图像数据集的分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在提取特征时存在不对称性：文本提取层次特征，而图像仅用单一特征表示，导致模态对齐效果不佳。

Method: 1. 构建语义感知的视觉特征提取框架，使用交叉注意力机制从中间Transformer层提取粗到细的视觉特征；2. 将两种模态的特征树嵌入到具有不同曲率的双曲流形中；3. 通过最小化异构流形间的KL距离来学习中间流形进行对齐。

Result: 在多个图像数据集上的分类任务实验中，该方法在少样本和跨域设置下均优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: 跨树对齐方法通过构建层次特征和对齐异构双曲流形，有效解决了视觉语言模型中的模态对齐问题，证明了最优中间流形的存在性和唯一性。

Abstract: Modality alignment is critical for vision-language models (VLMs) to
effectively integrate information across modalities. However, existing methods
extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a
single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address
this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns
tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities.
Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework
that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from
intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual
features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the
two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to
effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the
heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL
distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an
intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We
prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold.
Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image
datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines
under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

*Aditya Parikh,Sneha Das,Aasa Feragen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究审计了乳腺癌肿瘤分割数据集MAMA-MIA中自动分割标签的公平性，发现存在针对年轻患者的年龄相关偏见，这种偏见在控制混杂因素后仍然持续存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型旨在改善诊断工作流程，但公平性评估在图像分割等任务中仍未充分探索。未解决的分割偏见可能导致某些人群的护理质量差异，并在临床决策点和迭代模型开发中被放大。

Method: 研究团队评估了MAMA-MIA数据集中自动分割质量在年龄、种族和数据源方面的表现，分析了年龄相关偏见在控制混杂因素后的持续性。

Result: 分析揭示了针对年轻患者的内在年龄相关偏见，这种偏见在控制数据源等混杂因素后仍然持续存在。此外，聚合多个数据源会影响特定站点的种族偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在细粒度水平上调查数据的必要性，年龄偏见可能与生理因素相关，这是放射科医生和自动化系统都面临的已知挑战。

Abstract: Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness
evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image
segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the
quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical
decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we
audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast
cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation
quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an
intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist
even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We
hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known
challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how
aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic
biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.

### [42] [Mitigating Semantic Collapse in Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27432)
*WonJun Moon,MinSeok Jung,Gilhan Park,Tae-Young Kim,Cheol-Ho Cho,Woojin Jun,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对部分相关视频检索中的语义塌陷问题，提出了文本相关性保持学习和跨分支视频对齐方法，有效防止文本和视频嵌入空间的语义塌陷，显著提升检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将所有标注的文本-视频对视为正样本，其他视为负样本，忽略了单个视频内和不同视频间的丰富语义变化，导致同一视频中不同事件的查询和视频片段嵌入塌陷在一起，而不同视频中语义相似的查询和片段被推远，限制了包含多个不同事件视频的检索性能。

Method: 1. 文本相关性保持学习：保持基础模型编码的文本查询间的语义关系；2. 跨分支视频对齐：一种对比对齐方法，在时间尺度上解缠层次化视频表示；3. 顺序保持标记合并和自适应CBVA：通过生成内部一致且相互区分的视频片段来增强对齐。

Result: 在PRVR基准测试上的大量实验表明，该框架有效防止了语义塌陷，并显著提高了检索准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了部分相关视频检索中的语义塌陷问题，通过保持文本语义关系和跨分支视频对齐，显著提升了多事件视频的检索性能。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the
content matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video
pair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic
variation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently,
embeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for
distinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of
semantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven
apart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse
events. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic
collapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text
Correlation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships
encoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in
video embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive
alignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across
temporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and
adaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are
internally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic
collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

TL;DR: CoMViT是一个紧凑且可泛化的Vision Transformer架构，专为资源受限的医疗图像分析优化，通过集成卷积分词器、对角掩码、动态温度缩放和池化序列聚合等技术，在保持轻量设计（约450万参数）的同时，在12个MedMNIST数据集上实现稳健性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在医疗成像中展现出强大潜力，但其高计算需求和在小数据集上的过拟合倾向限制了在真实临床场景中的应用，因此需要开发更紧凑和可泛化的架构。

Method: CoMViT集成了卷积分词器、对角掩码、动态温度缩放和池化序列聚合等技术，通过系统架构优化来提升性能和泛化能力。

Result: CoMViT在12个MedMNIST数据集上实现稳健性能，匹配或优于更深的CNN和ViT变体，提供5-20倍的参数减少而不牺牲准确性。定性Grad-CAM分析显示CoMViT尽管尺寸紧凑，仍能持续关注临床相关区域。

Conclusion: 这些结果突出了原则性ViT重新设计在低资源医疗成像环境中开发高效且可解释模型的潜力。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong potential in medical
imaging; however, their high computational demands and tendency to overfit on
small datasets limit their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. In
this paper, we present CoMViT, a compact and generalizable Vision Transformer
architecture optimized for resource-constrained medical image analysis. CoMViT
integrates a convolutional tokenizer, diagonal masking, dynamic temperature
scaling, and pooling-based sequence aggregation to improve performance and
generalization. Through systematic architectural optimization, CoMViT achieves
robust performance across twelve MedMNIST datasets while maintaining a
lightweight design with only ~4.5M parameters. It matches or outperforms deeper
CNN and ViT variants, offering up to 5-20x parameter reduction without
sacrificing accuracy. Qualitative Grad-CAM analyses show that CoMViT
consistently attends to clinically relevant regions despite its compact size.
These results highlight the potential of principled ViT redesign for developing
efficient and interpretable models in low-resource medical imaging settings.

TL;DR: VisPainter是一个基于模型上下文协议的多智能体框架，用于生成可编辑的科学插图。它通过Manager、Designer和Toolbox三个模块协作生成标准矢量图形，实现元素级控制。同时提出了VisBench基准测试，从内容、布局、视觉感知和交互成本四个维度评估科学插图质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前生成模型在科学插图创作中的两个主要限制：基于图像的生成模型缺乏语义结构，无法编辑独立视觉组件；基于代码的生成方法缺乏直观性且编辑流程繁琐。需要一种既能提供元素级控制又具有直观操作性的科学插图生成方法。

Method: 提出VisPainter多智能体框架，包含三个专门模块：Manager负责协调，Designer负责设计，Toolbox提供工具支持。框架采用模块化、基于角色的设计，每个元素都可以显式表示和操作。同时提出VisBench基准测试，包含七个维度的评估指标。

Result: 通过大量消融实验验证了架构的合理性和评估方法的可靠性。评估了各种视觉语言模型，提供了公平可信的模型排名和详细的能力比较。量化分析了角色划分、步骤控制和描述对插图质量的影响。

Conclusion: VisPainter框架成功解决了科学插图创作中效率、直观性和迭代修改的需求，实现了真正的元素级控制。VisBench基准测试为科学插图质量评估提供了系统化的方法。

Abstract: Scientific illustrations demand both high information density and
post-editability. However, current generative models have two major
limitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking
semantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange
independent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation
methods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users
into the cumbersome cycle of "writing-compiling-reviewing" and lack the
intuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet
the needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in
scientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent
framework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol.
VisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a
Toolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector
graphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be
explicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and
any element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the
quality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with
seven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density
scientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception,
and interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments
to verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our
evaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models,
presenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of
their respective capabilities. Additionally, we isolated and quantified the
impacts of role division, step control,and description on the quality of
illustrations.

*Casper Fibaek,Abi Riley,Kelsey Doerksen,Do-Hyung Kim,Rochelle Schneider*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个多层人机交互框架，通过机器学习分析人口密度、土地覆盖和基础设施，结合中高分辨率卫星影像和深度学习模型，识别和验证学校位置，提高教育设施记录的准确性和完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在发展中地区，教育设施记录往往稀缺且更新不及时，需要一种可扩展且成本效益高的方法来改善学校地图数据的准确性和完整性。

Method: 采用多层方法：第一层使用机器学习分析人口密度、土地覆盖和现有基础设施；第二层使用中分辨率卫星影像识别可能存在的学校区域；第三层使用超高分辨率影像和深度学习模型生成详细的候选学校位置；最后通过交互界面让人工操作员审查、验证和优化结果。

Result: 初步评估表明，该多层策略为教育基础设施地图绘制提供了可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案，支持规划和资源分配。

Conclusion: 该多层人机交互框架能够有效提高学校地图数据的准确性和完整性，特别是在数据稀缺的发展中地区，为教育规划和资源分配提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for
interactive school mapping designed to improve the accuracy and completeness of
educational facility records, particularly in developing regions where such
data may be scarce and infrequently updated. The first tier involves a machine
learning based analysis of population density, land cover, and existing
infrastructure compared with known school locations. The first tier identifies
potential gaps and "mislabelled" schools. In subsequent tiers,
medium-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) is investigated to pinpoint
regions with a high likelihood of school presence, followed by the application
of very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and deep learning models to generate
detailed candidate locations for schools within these prioritised areas. The
medium-resolution approach was later removed due to insignificant improvements.
The medium and VHR resolution models build upon global pre-trained steps to
improve generalisation. A key component of the proposed approach is an
interactive interface to allow human operators to iteratively review, validate,
and refine the mapping results. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the
multi-tiered strategy provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for
educational infrastructure mapping to support planning and resource allocation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Referee的参考感知音视频深度伪造检测方法，利用单样本的说话人特定线索来检测超出时空伪影的操纵，通过跨模态特征匹配实现音视频同步性和身份一致性推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于先进生成模型生成的深度伪造内容构成严重威胁，现有音视频深度伪造检测方法难以泛化到未见过的伪造内容。

Method: 从单样本示例中提取说话人特定线索，通过将参考内容和目标内容中的身份相关查询匹配和对齐到跨模态特征中，联合推理音视频同步性和身份一致性。

Result: 在FakeAVCeleb、FaceForensics++和KoDF数据集上的广泛实验表明，Referee在跨数据集和跨语言评估协议上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 实验结果强调了跨模态身份验证对未来深度伪造检测的重要性。

Abstract: Since deepfakes generated by advanced generative models have rapidly posed
serious threats, existing audiovisual deepfake detection approaches struggle to
generalize to unseen forgeries. We propose a novel reference-aware audiovisual
deepfake detection method, called Referee. Speaker-specific cues from only
one-shot examples are leveraged to detect manipulations beyond spatiotemporal
artifacts. By matching and aligning identity-related queries from reference and
target content into cross-modal features, Referee jointly reasons about
audiovisual synchrony and identity consistency. Extensive experiments on
FakeAVCeleb, FaceForensics++, and KoDF demonstrate that Referee achieves
state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset and cross-language evaluation
protocols. Experimental results highlight the importance of cross-modal
identity verification for future deepfake detection. The code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文构建了NautData数据集（包含145万图像-文本对），并提出了一种可插拔的视觉特征增强模块（VFE），结合物理先验提升水下场景理解模型的鲁棒性，最终构建了水下大语言模型NAUTILUS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下探索具有重要价值，但缺乏大规模水下多任务指令调优数据集，且水下图像退化问题干扰任务性能，阻碍了水下场景理解研究的发展。

Method: 构建NautData数据集支持8个水下场景理解任务；提出基于水下成像模型的物理先验，设计可插拔的视觉特征增强模块（VFE）来显式恢复清晰的水下信息；将VFE模块集成到LLaVA-1.5和Qwen2.5-VL基线模型中构建NAUTILUS模型。

Result: 在NautData和公开水下数据集上的实验表明，VFE模块有效提升了两个基线模型在大多数支持任务上的性能，确保了NAUTILUS在水下场景理解领域的优越性。

Conclusion: NautData数据集和VFE模块为水下场景理解研究提供了重要基础，NAUTILUS模型在该领域表现出色，数据和模型已开源。

Abstract: Underwater exploration offers critical insights into our planet and attracts
increasing attention for its broader applications in resource exploration,
national security, etc. We study the underwater scene understanding methods,
which aim to achieve automated underwater exploration. The underwater scene
understanding task demands multi-task perceptions from multiple granularities.
However, the absence of large-scale underwater multi-task instruction-tuning
datasets hinders the progress of this research. To bridge this gap, we
construct NautData, a dataset containing 1.45 M image-text pairs supporting
eight underwater scene understanding tasks. It enables the development and
thorough evaluation of the underwater scene understanding models. Underwater
image degradation is a widely recognized challenge that interferes with
underwater tasks. To improve the robustness of underwater scene understanding,
we introduce physical priors derived from underwater imaging models and propose
a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module, which explicitly
restores clear underwater information. We integrate this module into renowned
baselines LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL and build our underwater LMM, NAUTILUS.
Experiments conducted on the NautData and public underwater datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the VFE module, consistently improving the
performance of both baselines on the majority of supported tasks, thus ensuring
the superiority of NAUTILUS in the underwater scene understanding area. Data
and models are available at https://github.com/H-EmbodVis/NAUTILUS.

TL;DR: ThinkMorph是一个统一的多模态推理模型，通过24K高质量交错推理轨迹进行微调，能够生成渐进式的文本-图像推理步骤，在视觉中心基准测试中平均提升34.7%，并展现出新兴的多模态智能能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态推理需要语言和视觉之间的迭代协调，但目前尚不清楚什么构成了有意义的交错思维链。研究者认为文本和图像思维应该作为互补而非同构的模态，共同推进推理过程。

Method: 构建ThinkMorph统一模型，在24K高质量交错推理轨迹上进行微调，涵盖不同视觉参与度的任务。模型学习生成渐进式的文本-图像推理步骤，具体操作视觉内容同时保持连贯的言语逻辑。

Result: 在视觉中心基准测试中平均提升34.7%，在领域外任务上表现良好，匹配或超越更大规模和专有的视觉语言模型。展现出新兴的多模态智能能力，包括未见过的视觉操作技能、自适应切换推理模式以及通过多样化多模态思维实现更好的测试时扩展。

Conclusion: 这些发现为表征统一多模态推理模型的新兴能力提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning requires iterative coordination between language and
vision, yet it remains unclear what constitutes a meaningful interleaved chain
of thought. We posit that text and image thoughts should function as
complementary, rather than isomorphic, modalities that mutually advance
reasoning. Guided by this principle, we build ThinkMorph, a unified model
fine-tuned on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with
varying visual engagement. ThinkMorph learns to generate progressive text-image
reasoning steps that concretely manipulate visual content while maintaining
coherent verbal logic. It delivers large gains on vision-centric benchmarks
(averaging 34.7% over the base model) and generalizes to out-of-domain tasks,
matching or surpassing larger and proprietary VLMs. Beyond performance,
ThinkMorph exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence, including unseen visual
manipulation skills, adaptive switching between reasoning modes, and better
test-time scaling through diversified multimodal thoughts.These findings
suggest promising directions for characterizing the emergent capabilities of
unified models for multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: MapSAM2是一个基于视觉基础模型的统一框架，用于自动分割历史地图图像和时间序列，通过将地图处理为视频来提升几何精度，并提出了伪时间序列生成方法来减少标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图是记录不同时期地理特征的宝贵档案，但由于风格多样性和标注数据稀缺，其自动分析面临挑战。构建链接的时空数据集需要从多张地图中合成信息，过程耗时耗力。

Method: 将历史地图图像和时间序列视为视频处理：对于图像，将一组图块作为视频处理，利用记忆注意力机制整合相似图块的上下文线索；对于时间序列，提出从单年地图生成伪时间序列的方法，模拟常见时间变换来减少标注成本。

Result: 实验结果表明，MapSAM2能有效学习时间关联，在有限监督或使用伪视频的情况下，能准确分割和链接时间序列中的建筑物。

Conclusion: MapSAM2框架在历史地图分割任务中表现出色，能够处理多样化的分割任务，并将发布数据集和代码以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Historical maps are unique and valuable archives that document geographic
features across different time periods. However, automated analysis of
historical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide
stylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing
linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more
time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information
from multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating
buildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying
environmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for
automatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a
visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with
few-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images
and time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video,
enabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from
similar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal
features. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time
Series Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time
series from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations.
Experimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively
and can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited
supervision or using pseudo videos. We will release both our dataset and code
to support future research.

TL;DR: Spatial-SSRL是一种自监督强化学习范式，通过从普通RGB或RGB-D图像中提取可验证信号来提升大型视觉语言模型的空间理解能力，无需昂贵的人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型在空间理解方面存在不足，而传统的监督微调和强化学习方法依赖昂贵的监督数据、专用工具或受限环境，限制了规模化应用。

Method: 提出Spatial-SSRL自监督强化学习范式，自动构建五种捕获2D和3D空间结构的预训练任务：打乱补丁重排序、翻转补丁识别、裁剪补丁修复、区域深度排序和相对3D位置预测。这些任务提供易于验证的真实答案，无需人工或LVLM标注。

Result: 在七个空间理解基准测试中，Spatial-SSRL相比Qwen2.5-VL基线在图像和视频设置下分别实现了4.63%（3B）和3.89%（7B）的平均准确率提升，同时保持了通用视觉能力。

Conclusion: 简单的内在监督能够实现规模化强化学习，为增强LVLM的空间智能提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Spatial understanding remains a weakness of Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and recent reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines depend on costly supervision,
specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scale. We introduce
Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm that derives verifiable signals
directly from ordinary RGB or RGB-D images. Spatial-SSRL automatically
formulates five pretext tasks that capture 2D and 3D spatial structure:
shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting,
regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction. These tasks
provide ground-truth answers that are easy to verify and require no human or
LVLM annotation. Training on our tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning
while preserving general visual capabilities. On seven spatial understanding
benchmarks in both image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL delivers average
accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over the Qwen2.5-VL baselines. Our
results show that simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and
provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

Conclusion: DUST框架有效解决了多模态预测的挑战，在仿真和真实环境中都表现出优越性能，并展示了大规模视觉-语言-动作模型预训练的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, augmenting Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with world modeling
has shown promise in improving robotic policy learning. However, it remains
challenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences
because of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,
we propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework
that handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across
diverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer
architecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still
enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent
noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This
design enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional
manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the
decoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling
method that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve
asynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks
such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods,
while our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On
real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by
13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training
on action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on
RoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.

Abstract: Graphic layout generation is a growing research area focusing on generating
aesthetically pleasing layouts ranging from poster designs to documents. While
recent research has explored ways to incorporate user constraints to guide the
layout generation, these constraints often require complex specifications which
reduce usability. We introduce an innovative approach exploiting user-provided
sketches as intuitive constraints and we demonstrate empirically the
effectiveness of this new guidance method, establishing the sketch-to-layout
problem as a promising research direction, which is currently under-explored.
To tackle the sketch-to-layout problem, we propose a multimodal
transformer-based solution using the sketch and the content assets as inputs to
produce high quality layouts. Since collecting sketch training data from human
annotators to train our model is very costly, we introduce a novel and
efficient method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale. We train
and evaluate our model on three publicly available datasets: PubLayNet,
DocLayNet and SlidesVQA, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art
constraint-based methods, while offering a more intuitive design experience. In
order to facilitate future sketch-to-layout research, we release O(200k)
synthetically-generated sketches for the public datasets above. The datasets
are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/sketch_to_layout.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VessShape方法，通过生成大规模2D合成血管数据集来增强分割模型的形状偏置，解决医学图像分析中血管分割的数据稀缺和跨模态泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 血管语义分割面临标注数据稀缺和模型跨成像模态泛化能力差的问题，主要原因是CNN倾向于学习纹理特征而非形状特征。

Method: 开发VessShape方法生成大规模合成血管数据集，包含程序化生成的管状几何结构和多样化纹理，强制模型学习形状线索而非纹理特征。

Result: 在VessShape上预训练的模型在两个真实世界数据集上表现出强大的少样本分割性能（仅需4-10个样本微调），并具有显著的零样本能力，能在未见领域有效分割血管。

Conclusion: 具有强形状偏置的预训练是克服数据稀缺和提升血管分割模型泛化能力的有效策略。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image
analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated
datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging
modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when
applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize
that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and
branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To
investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating
large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in
segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular
geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,
encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate
that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot
segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,
requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model
exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in
unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that
pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome
data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的高斯组合距离(GCD)方法，用于解决小目标检测中IoU和Wasserstein距离的局限性，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小目标检测中IoU对位置偏差敏感以及Wasserstein距离缺乏尺度不变性和优化效率低的问题。

Method: 提出高斯组合距离(GCD)，通过分析GCD及其梯度，证明其具有尺度不变性并能促进联合优化，提高模型定位性能。

Result: 在AI-TOD-v2小目标检测数据集上，GCD作为边界框回归损失函数和标签分配指标，在各种检测器中实现了最先进的性能。在MS-COCO-2017和Visdrone-2019数据集上验证了GCD的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GCD是一种有效的相似性度量方法，具有尺度不变性和更好的优化特性，在小目标检测中优于现有方法。

Abstract: In object detection, a well-defined similarity metric can significantly
enhance model performance. Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the
most commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a
similarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of
their sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent
studies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for
measuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we
have observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which
negatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when
used as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes
leads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).
Through analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD
not only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,
which enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the
AI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box
regression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability
of GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the
Wasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无监督深度学习的去噪框架，用于提升定量显微镜工作流程的质量，该框架能够跨模态和尺度保持物理保真度、减少偏差，并在多种实验应用中显著降低噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 操作显微镜在揭示功能材料的动态化学物理过程方面具有重要作用，但测量噪声限制了有效分辨率并影响定量分析的准确性。

Method: 开发了一个通用的无监督深度学习去噪框架，通过PDE约束优化进行模型学习，并在扫描透射X射线显微镜、光学显微镜和中子射线照相等多种实验中进行应用验证。

Result: 在模拟数据中，深度去噪保持了物理保真度，引入的偏差最小，并减少了模型学习的不确定性。在实验中，去噪揭示了锂铁磷酸盐的纳米级化学和结构异质性，实现了石墨电极中颗粒分割和相分类的自动化，并将中子射线照相中的噪声诱导变异性降低了近80%。

Conclusion: 深度去噪作为一种强大的、与模态无关的增强技术，推进了定量操作成像的发展，并扩展了先前受噪声限制技术的应用范围。

Abstract: Operando microscopy provides direct insight into the dynamic chemical and
physical processes that govern functional materials, yet measurement noise
limits the effective resolution and undermines quantitative analysis. Here, we
present a general framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based
denoising into quantitative microscopy workflows across modalities and length
scales. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that deep denoising preserves
physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in model
learning with partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization.
Applied to experiments, denoising reveals nanoscale chemical and structural
heterogeneity in scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) of lithium iron
phosphate (LFP), enables automated particle segmentation and phase
classification in optical microscopy of graphite electrodes, and reduces
noise-induced variability by nearly 80% in neutron radiography to resolve
heterogeneous lithium transport. Collectively, these results establish deep
denoising as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances
quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited
techniques.

Motivation: 现有行人重识别方法在遮挡、视角扭曲和图像质量差的情况下表现不佳，需要轻量级且鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 基于ViT-Base构建Sh-ViT，包含三个核心组件：Transformer末层的Shuffle模块、场景适应数据增强、DeiT知识蒸馏。

Result: 在MyTT数据集上达到83.2% Rank-1和80.1% mAP，在Market1501上达到94.6% Rank-1和87.5% mAP，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: Sh-ViT无需外部模块即可提升对遮挡和模糊的鲁棒性，为监控场景下的人员监测提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) in surveillance is challenged by occlusion,
viewpoint distortion, and poor image quality. Most existing methods rely on
complex modules or perform well only on clear frontal images. We propose Sh-ViT
(Shuffling Vision Transformer), a lightweight and robust model for occluded
person ReID. Built on ViT-Base, Sh-ViT introduces three components: First, a
Shuffle module in the final Transformer layer to break spatial correlations and
enhance robustness to occlusion and blur; Second, scenario-adapted augmentation
(geometric transforms, erasing, blur, and color adjustment) to simulate
surveillance conditions; Third, DeiT-based knowledge distillation to improve
learning with limited labels.To support real-world evaluation, we construct the
MyTT dataset, containing over 10,000 pedestrians and 30,000+ images from base
station inspections, with frequent equipment occlusion and camera variations.
Experiments show that Sh-ViT achieves 83.2% Rank-1 and 80.1% mAP on MyTT,
outperforming CNN and ViT baselines, and 94.6% Rank-1 and 87.5% mAP on
Market1501, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.In summary, Sh-ViT improves
robustness to occlusion and blur without external modules, offering a practical

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在医学应用中主要局限于2D成像，而3D PET/CT具有大容量体数据、小而分散的病灶以及冗长放射学报告的特点，需要专门的处理方法。

Method: 构建了包含11,000多个病灶级描述与3D分割配对的PET/CT数据集，采用基于规则和大型语言模型的混合提取流程。提出PETAR-4B模型，整合PET、CT和病灶轮廓信息，实现全局上下文推理与细粒度病灶感知的结合。

Conclusion: PETAR模型成功将视觉语言模型扩展到3D PET/CT领域，为医学影像报告生成提供了新的解决方案，推动了3D医学视觉语言理解的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D
imaging. In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and
computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data,
small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a
large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired
with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid
rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset,
we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET,
CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges
global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing
clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human
evaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report
generation quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding.

TL;DR: Phased DMD是一种多步蒸馏框架，结合了分阶段蒸馏和专家混合思想，解决了DMD在复杂生成任务中性能不足的问题，同时保持了生成多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DMD在复杂生成任务中因模型容量限制导致的性能不足问题，同时避免多步蒸馏带来的内存消耗和计算深度增加导致的训练不稳定和效率降低。

Method: 提出Phased DMD框架，包含两个关键思想：渐进式分布匹配和子区间内的分数匹配。将SNR范围划分为子区间，逐步将模型细化到更高SNR水平，以更好地捕捉复杂分布。

Result: 在蒸馏最先进的图像和视频生成模型（包括Qwen-Image和Wan2.2）的实验中，Phased DMD比DMD更好地保持了输出多样性，同时保留了关键的生成能力。

Conclusion: Phased DMD通过分阶段蒸馏和专家混合方法，有效解决了多步蒸馏中的训练不稳定和多样性损失问题，在保持生成质量的同时提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills score-based generative
models into efficient one-step generators, without requiring a one-to-one
correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However,
limited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex
generative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video
generation. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory
usage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.
While prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential
solution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of
multi-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step
counterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step
distillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model
capacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution
matching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the
SNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR
levels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training
objective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous
mathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art
image and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and
Wan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD
preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative
capabilities. We will release our code and models.

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for the identification of notifiable events in the
domain of healthcare. The methodology harnesses semantic frames to define
fine-grained patterns and search them in unstructured data, namely, open-text
fields in e-medical records. We apply the methodology to the problem of
underreporting of gender-based violence (GBV) in e-medical records produced
during patients' visits to primary care units. A total of eight patterns are
defined and searched on a corpus of 21 million sentences in Brazilian
Portuguese extracted from e-SUS APS. The results are manually evaluated by
linguists and the precision of each pattern measured. Our findings reveal that
the methodology effectively identifies reports of violence with a precision of
0.726, confirming its robustness. Designed as a transparent, efficient,
low-carbon, and language-agnostic pipeline, the approach can be easily adapted
to other health surveillance contexts, contributing to the broader, ethical,
and explainable use of NLP in public health systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the increasing use of conversational AI systems, there is growing
concern over privacy leaks, especially when users share sensitive personal data
in interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). Conversations shared with
these models may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which, if
exposed, could lead to security breaches or identity theft. To address this
challenge, we present the Local Optimizations for Pseudonymization with
Semantic Integrity Directed Entity Detection (LOPSIDED) framework, a
semantically-aware privacy agent designed to safeguard sensitive PII data when
using remote LLMs. Unlike prior work that often degrade response quality, our
approach dynamically replaces sensitive PII entities in user prompts with
semantically consistent pseudonyms, preserving the contextual integrity of
conversations. Once the model generates its response, the pseudonyms are
automatically depseudonymized, ensuring the user receives an accurate,
privacy-preserving output. We evaluate our approach using real-world
conversations sourced from ShareGPT, which we further augment and annotate to
assess whether named entities are contextually relevant to the model's
response. Our results show that LOPSIDED reduces semantic utility errors by a
factor of 5 compared to baseline techniques, all while enhancing privacy.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Several previous works concluded that the largest part of generation
capabilities of large language models (LLM) are learned (early) during
pre-training. However, LLMs still require further alignment to adhere to
downstream task requirements and stylistic preferences, among other desired
properties. As LLMs continue to scale in terms of size, the computational cost
of alignment procedures increase prohibitively. In this work, we propose a
novel approach to circumvent these costs via proxy-based test-time alignment,
i.e. using guidance from a small aligned model. Our approach can be described
as token-specific cascading method, where the token-specific deferral rule is
reduced to 0-1 knapsack problem. In this setting, we derive primal and dual
approximations of the optimal deferral decision. We experimentally show the
benefits of our method both in task performance and speculative decoding speed.

Abstract: As large pre-trained language models become increasingly critical to natural

requirements have raised significant economic and environmental concerns.
Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces the Elastic Language Model
(ELM), a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method optimized for compact

effective exploration of model architectures. We also introduce novel knowledge
distillation losses that preserve the unique characteristics of each block, in
order to improve the discrimination between architectural choices during the
search process. Experiments on masked language modeling and causal language
modeling tasks demonstrate that models discovered by ELM significantly
outperform existing methods.

Abstract: Sexism reinforces gender inequality and social exclusion by perpetuating
stereotypes, bias, and discriminatory norms. Noting how online platforms enable
various forms of sexism to thrive, there is a growing need for effective sexism
detection and mitigation strategies. While computational approaches to sexism
detection are widespread in high-resource languages, progress remains limited
in low-resource languages where limited linguistic resources and cultural
differences affect how sexism is expressed and perceived. This study introduces
the first Hausa sexism detection dataset, developed through community
engagement, qualitative coding, and data augmentation. For cultural nuances and
linguistic representation, we conducted a two-stage user study (n=66) involving
native speakers to explore how sexism is defined and articulated in everyday
discourse. We further experiment with both traditional machine learning
classifiers and pre-trained multilingual language models and evaluating the
effectiveness few-shot learning in detecting sexism in Hausa. Our findings
highlight challenges in capturing cultural nuance, particularly with
clarification-seeking and idiomatic expressions, and reveal a tendency for many
false positives in such cases.

<details>

Motivation: 先前研究认为递归数字系统优化了词典大小和平均形态句法复杂性之间的权衡，但需要依赖临时约束来排除不自然系统。本文认为问题在于忽略了规律性这一人类语法中的关键复杂性方面。

Method: 采用最小描述长度方法，提出基于规律性和处理复杂性的度量来评估递归数字系统的效率。

Result: 基于MDL的规律性和处理复杂性度量能更好地区分自然系统与不自然但可能的系统，包括先前研究中的"最优"递归数字系统，且先前文献中的临时约束自然地从规律性中得出。

Conclusion: 在试图衡量和解释语言最优性的研究中，需要将形式集合的规律性纳入考量。

Abstract: Previous work has argued that recursive numeral systems optimise the
trade-off between lexicon size and average morphosyntatic complexity (Deni\'c
and Szymanik, 2024). However, showing that only natural-language-like systems
optimise this tradeoff has proven elusive, and the existing solution has relied
on ad-hoc constraints to rule out unnatural systems (Yang and Regier, 2025).
Here, we argue that this issue arises because the proposed trade-off has
neglected regularity, a crucial aspect of complexity central to human grammars
in general. Drawing on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) approach, we
propose that recursive numeral systems are better viewed as efficient with
regard to their regularity and processing complexity. We show that our
MDL-based measures of regularity and processing complexity better capture the
key differences between attested, natural systems and unattested but possible
ones, including "optimal" recursive numeral systems from previous work, and
that the ad-hoc constraints from previous literature naturally follow from
regularity. Our approach highlights the need to incorporate regularity across
sets of forms in studies that attempt to measure and explain optimality in
language.

Abstract: Hallucination--defined here as generating statements unsupported or
contradicted by available evidence or conversational context--remains a major
obstacle to deploying conversational AI systems in settings that demand factual
reliability. Existing metrics either evaluate isolated responses or treat
unverifiable content as errors, limiting their use for multi-turn dialogue. We
introduce VISTA (Verification In Sequential Turn-based Assessment), a framework
for evaluating conversational factuality through claim-level verification and
sequential consistency tracking. VISTA decomposes each assistant turn into
atomic factual claims, verifies them against trusted sources and dialogue
history, and categorizes unverifiable statements (subjective, contradicted,
lacking evidence, or abstaining). Across eight large language models and four
dialogue factuality benchmarks (AIS, BEGIN, FAITHDIAL, and FADE), VISTA
substantially improves hallucination detection over FACTSCORE and LLM-as-Judge
baselines. Human evaluation confirms that VISTA's decomposition improves
annotator agreement and reveals inconsistencies in existing benchmarks. By
modeling factuality as a dynamic property of conversation, VISTA offers a more
transparent, human-aligned measure of truthfulness in dialogue systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多粒度记忆索引和不确定性估计的置信度控制方法，用于解决复杂知识环境下检索增强生成中的覆盖不足、结果不稳定和可靠性有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂知识环境下检索增强生成存在的覆盖不足、结果不稳定和可靠性有限的问题。

Method: 构建分层记忆结构将知识表示划分为不同粒度级别，实现从局部细节到全局上下文的动态索引和检索；引入不确定性估计机制，在生成过程中显式约束和过滤低置信度路径。

Result: 在问答准确性、检索召回率、排序质量和事实一致性方面优于现有模型，验证了该方法在不同场景下的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多粒度索引与置信度控制的结合为检索增强生成提供了新的技术路径，并为提高大模型在复杂上下文中的可靠性和可控性提供了实践证据。

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of insufficient coverage, unstable results,
and limited reliability in retrieval-augmented generation under complex
knowledge environments, and proposes a confidence control method that
integrates multi-granularity memory indexing with uncertainty estimation. The
method builds a hierarchical memory structure that divides knowledge
representations into different levels of granularity, enabling dynamic indexing
and retrieval from local details to global context, and thus establishing
closer semantic connections between retrieval and generation. On this basis, an
uncertainty estimation mechanism is introduced to explicitly constrain and
filter low-confidence paths during the generation process, allowing the model
to maintain information coverage while effectively suppressing noise and false
content. The overall optimization objective consists of generation loss,
entropy constraints, and variance regularization, forming a unified confidence
control framework. In the experiments, comprehensive sensitivity tests and
comparative analyses were designed, covering hyperparameters, environmental
conditions, and data structures, to verify the stability and robustness of the
proposed method across different scenarios. The results show that the method
achieves superior performance over existing models in QA accuracy, retrieval
recall, ranking quality, and factual consistency, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining multi-granularity indexing with confidence control.
This study not only provides a new technical pathway for retrieval-augmented
generation but also offers practical evidence for improving the reliability and
controllability of large models in complex contexts.

TL;DR: CoDeC是一种通过上下文学习检测大语言模型训练数据污染的方法，能够区分记忆数据和未见数据，并量化污染程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测大语言模型中训练数据的污染问题，特别是区分模型记忆的训练数据和未见数据，以评估模型训练数据的透明度和完整性。

Method: 通过测量上下文学习对模型性能的影响来检测数据污染，发现上下文示例通常能提升对未见数据集的置信度，但对训练过的数据集可能因记忆模式被破坏而降低置信度。

Result: CoDeC产生可解释的污染分数，能清晰区分已见和未见数据集，并在未公开训练语料的开源模型中发现了强记忆证据。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、自动化、模型和数据集无关，易于集成到基准评估中，为检测训练数据污染提供了实用且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Contamination Detection via Context (CoDeC), a practical and
accurate method to detect and quantify training data contamination in large
language models. CoDeC distinguishes between data memorized during training and
data outside the training distribution by measuring how in-context learning
affects model performance. We find that in-context examples typically boost
confidence for unseen datasets but may reduce it when the dataset was part of
training, due to disrupted memorization patterns. Experiments show that CoDeC
produces interpretable contamination scores that clearly separate seen and
unseen datasets, and reveals strong evidence of memorization in open-weight
models with undisclosed training corpora. The method is simple, automated, and
both model- and dataset-agnostic, making it easy to integrate with benchmark
evaluations.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在安全对齐和鲁棒性方面的局限性，构建更安全可信的对齐机制。

Method: 采用对比蒸馏和噪声鲁棒训练相结合的方法，冻结骨干模型，通过蒸馏损失、鲁棒性损失和正则化项构建统一优化目标。

Result: 在知识迁移、鲁棒性和整体安全性方面显著优于现有基线方法，在多个关键指标上达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅丰富了参数高效微调的理论体系，还为构建更安全可信的对齐机制提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of large-scale language models in safety
alignment and robustness by proposing a fine-tuning method that combines
contrastive distillation with noise-robust training. The method freezes the
backbone model and transfers the knowledge boundaries of the teacher model to
the student model through distillation, thereby improving semantic consistency
and alignment accuracy. At the same time, noise perturbations and robust
optimization constraints are introduced during training to ensure that the
model maintains stable predictive outputs under noisy and uncertain inputs. The
overall framework consists of distillation loss, robustness loss, and a
regularization term, forming a unified optimization objective that balances
alignment ability with resistance to interference. To systematically validate
its effectiveness, the study designs experiments from multiple perspectives,
including distillation weight sensitivity, stability analysis under computation
budgets and mixed-precision environments, and the impact of data noise and
distribution shifts on model performance. Results show that the method
significantly outperforms existing baselines in knowledge transfer, robustness,
and overall safety, achieving the best performance across several key metrics.
This work not only enriches the theoretical system of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning but also provides a new solution for building safer and more
trustworthy alignment mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM安全护栏在防止生成有害内容时可能引入的新偏见问题，特别是对不同人口群体的选择性拒绝现象。

Method: 通过分析针对个体和交叉人口群体的拒绝率、LLM响应类型以及生成拒绝内容的长度来评估选择性拒绝偏见。

Result: 发现LLM安全护栏在性别、性取向、国籍和宗教属性上存在明显的选择性拒绝偏见，并可通过间接攻击针对先前被拒绝的群体。

Conclusion: 需要开发更公平和鲁棒的安全护栏，确保在不同人口群体间具有一致的保护性能。

Abstract: Safety guardrails in large language models(LLMs) are developed to prevent
malicious users from generating toxic content at a large scale. However, these
measures can inadvertently introduce or reflect new biases, as LLMs may refuse
to generate harmful content targeting some demographic groups and not others.
We explore this selective refusal bias in LLM guardrails through the lens of
refusal rates of targeted individual and intersectional demographic groups,
types of LLM responses, and length of generated refusals. Our results show
evidence of selective refusal bias across gender, sexual orientation,
nationality, and religion attributes. This leads us to investigate additional
safety implications via an indirect attack, where we target previously refused
groups. Our findings emphasize the need for more equitable and robust
performance in safety guardrails across demographic groups.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现使用大型语言模型作为NLG评估器存在评分不一致性问题，在不同运行中评分可靠性低，导致评估结果几乎随机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自然语言生成技术广泛应用，准确评估生成质量变得困难。虽然LLM评估器比传统指标更符合人类偏好，但其评分一致性需要验证。

Method: 通过实验量化LLM评估器在不同NLG任务和基准测试中的评分不一致性，并探索在适当指导原则下如何有效使用LLM评估器。

Result: LLM评估器在不同运行中表现出低评分者内部可靠性，评分方差大，导致评估结果不一致甚至近乎随机。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM评估器存在评分不一致问题，但在遵循适当指导原则的情况下仍可谨慎使用。

Abstract: As Natural Language Generation (NLG) continues to be widely adopted, properly
assessing it has become quite difficult. Lately, using large language models
(LLMs) for evaluating these generations has gained traction, as they tend to
align more closely with human preferences than conventional n-gram or
embedding-based metrics. In our experiments, we show that LLM judges have low
intra-rater reliability in their assigned scores across different runs. This
variance makes their ratings inconsistent, almost arbitrary in the worst case,
making it difficult to measure how good their judgments actually are. We
quantify this inconsistency across different NLG tasks and benchmarks and see
if judicious use of LLM judges can still be useful following proper guidelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要将transformer视为语言识别器（接受或拒绝字符串），而非实际使用中作为语言模型（自回归概率生成字符串）。本文旨在分析transformer在语言模型使用场景下的概率分布表达能力。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究transformer语言识别器在转变为自回归模式时的表达能力变化，以及在引入概率性后对原有等价关系的破坏。

Result: 发现自回归化有时能增强transformer的表达能力，而概率化会打破非概率情况下的某些等价关系。

Conclusion: 本文系统分析了transformer在语言模型使用场景下的函数表达能力，为理解其在实际应用中的能力边界提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Most expressivity results for transformers treat them as language recognizers
(which accept or reject strings), and not as they are used in practice, as
language models (which generate strings autoregressively and
probabilistically). Here, we characterize the probability distributions that
transformer language models can express. We show that making transformer
language recognizers autoregressive can sometimes increase their expressivity,
and that making them probabilistic can break equivalences that hold in the
non-probabilistic case. Our overall contribution is to tease apart what
functions transformers are capable of expressing, in their most common use-case
as language models.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了URIEL+语言知识库，通过引入脚本向量、整合Glottolog语言数据和改进谱系插补方法，显著减少了数据稀疏性问题，提升了多语言研究的覆盖范围和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: URIEL+语言知识库存在数据稀疏问题，包括缺失特征类型、不完整的语言条目和有限的谱系覆盖，这限制了其在跨语言迁移特别是低资源语言支持方面的实用性。

Method: 1）为7,488种语言引入脚本向量来表示书写系统属性；2）整合Glottolog数据库，增加18,710种语言；3）扩展谱系插补方法，为26,449种语言传播类型学和脚本特征。

Result: 脚本向量的特征稀疏性减少14%，语言覆盖范围最多增加19,015种语言（增长1,007%），插补质量指标最多提升33%。在跨语言迁移任务中，某些设置下性能提升达6%。

Conclusion: 这些扩展使URIEL+在多语言研究中更加完整和包容，为低资源语言的跨语言迁移提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: The URIEL+ linguistic knowledge base supports multilingual research by
encoding languages through geographic, genetic, and typological vectors.
However, data sparsity remains prevalent, in the form of missing feature types,
incomplete language entries, and limited genealogical coverage. This limits the
usefulness of URIEL+ in cross-lingual transfer, particularly for supporting
low-resource languages. To address this sparsity, this paper extends URIEL+
with three contributions: introducing script vectors to represent writing
system properties for 7,488 languages, integrating Glottolog to add 18,710
additional languages, and expanding lineage imputation for 26,449 languages by
propagating typological and script features across genealogies. These additions
reduce feature sparsity by 14% for script vectors, increase language coverage
by up to 19,015 languages (1,007%), and improve imputation quality metrics by
up to 33%. Our benchmark on cross-lingual transfer tasks (oriented around
low-resource languages) shows occasionally divergent performance compared to
URIEL+, with performance gains up to 6% in certain setups. Our advances make
URIEL+ more complete and inclusive for multilingual research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信息密度理论的最新进展引发了对自然语言编码信息周期性程度的探讨，研究旨在量化语言中信息周期性模式的存在程度。

Method: 采用APS方法，这是一种基于典型周期性检测算法的技术，能够识别单个文档惊异值序列中存在的任何显著周期。

Result: 发现人类语言中相当大比例存在强烈的信息周期性模式；识别并验证了超出典型文本结构单元分布的新周期；通过谐波回归模型进一步确认了这些发现。

Conclusion: 语言中的信息周期性是结构化因素和长距离作用因素共同作用的结果；该方法在LLM生成检测方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Recent theoretical advancement of information density in natural language has
brought the following question on desk: To what degree does natural language
exhibit periodicity pattern in its encoded information? We address this
question by introducing a new method called AutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS). APS
adopts a canonical periodicity detection algorithm and is able to identify any
significant periods that exist in the surprisal sequence of a single document.
By applying the algorithm to a set of corpora, we have obtained the following
interesting results: Firstly, a considerable proportion of human language
demonstrates a strong pattern of periodicity in information; Secondly, new
periods that are outside the distributions of typical structural units in text
(e.g., sentence boundaries, elementary discourse units, etc.) are found and
further confirmed via harmonic regression modeling. We conclude that the
periodicity of information in language is a joint outcome from both structured
factors and other driving factors that take effect at longer distances. The
advantages of our periodicity detection method and its potentials in
LLM-generation detection are further discussed.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了BEAM基准测试和LIGHT框架，用于评估和改进大语言模型在长对话中的记忆能力。BEAM包含100个长对话和2000个验证问题，LIGHT框架为LLMs配备了三种互补的记忆系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏叙事连贯性、覆盖领域狭窄，且仅测试简单的回忆任务，无法充分评估LLMs在需要长期记忆的长上下文推理任务中的能力。

Method: 1. 开发BEAM基准：自动生成长达1000万token的连贯对话和多样化问题；2. 提出LIGHT框架：为LLMs配备长期情景记忆、短期工作记忆和事实积累便签三种记忆系统。

Result: 实验显示，即使具有100万token上下文窗口的LLMs（无论是否使用检索增强）在对话变长时表现都会下降。相比之下，LIGHT框架在各种模型上持续提升性能，比最强基线平均提升3.5%-12.69%。

Conclusion: LIGHT框架通过模拟人类认知的多记忆系统，有效提升了LLMs在长对话中的记忆能力，消融研究证实了每个记忆组件的贡献。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large language models (LLMs) for tasks that
require long-term memory and thus long-context reasoning, for example in
conversational settings, is hampered by the existing benchmarks, which often
lack narrative coherence, cover narrow domains, and only test simple
recall-oriented tasks. This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these
challenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating
long (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations,
accompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities.
From this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and
2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose
LIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three
complementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working
memory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on
BEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without
retrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT
consistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average
improvement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the
backbone LLM. An ablation study further confirms the contribution of each
memory component.

TL;DR: LLINK是一种计算高效的语言作为模态的方法，通过在保留位置将多语言编码器的句子嵌入对齐到解码器的潜在嵌入空间，并使用轻量级对比投影器和最小适配器，显著提升双语检索性能，在低资源非拉丁文字上优于基础模型和直接微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令调优的大型语言模型在低资源非拉丁文字上表现不佳，主要由于分词器碎片化和弱跨语言耦合问题。

Method: 首先通过轻量级对比投影器将冻结多语言编码器的句子嵌入对齐到解码器的潜在嵌入空间；然后将向量扩展为K个软槽，并使用最小适配器训练，使冻结解码器能够消费信号。

Result: LLINK显著改善双语检索，在LLM评判的问答评估中，81.3%优于基础模型，63.6%优于直接微调；减少了分词膨胀并增强了跨语言对齐，尽管在数值保真度方面仍有残余弱点。

Conclusion: 将低资源语言视为模态为轻量级LLM中更强的跨语言对齐提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) underperform on low resource,
non-Latin scripts due to tokenizer fragmentation and weak cross-lingual
coupling. We present LLINK (Latent Language Injection for Non-English
Knowledge), a compute efficient language-as-modality method that conditions an
instruction-tuned decoder without changing the tokenizer or retraining the
decoder. First, we align sentence embeddings from a frozen multilingual encoder
to the decoder's latent embedding space at a reserved position via a
lightweight contrastive projector. Second, the vector is expanded into K soft
slots and trained with minimal adapters so the frozen decoder consumes the
signal. LLINK substantially improves bilingual retrieval and achieves 81.3%
preference over the base model and 63.6% over direct fine-tuning in LLM-judged
Q&A evaluations. We further find that improvements can be attributed to reduced
tokenization inflation and a stronger cross lingual alignment, despite the
model having residual weaknesses in numeric fidelity. Treating low resource
languages as a modality offers a practical path to stronger cross-lingual
alignment in lightweight LLMs.

Motivation: 现有医学基准主要关注问答和描述性推理，忽视了临床决策中至关重要的定量推理能力。现有数据集如MedCalc-Bench覆盖的计算任务较少，无法反映真实世界的计算场景。

Method: 创建了包含700多个任务的MedCalc-Eval基准，分为方程型计算（如Cockcroft-Gault、BMI、BSA）和规则型评分系统（如Apgar、Glasgow昏迷评分）。开发了基于InternBootcamp框架的MedCalc-Env强化学习环境，支持多步骤临床推理和规划。

Result: 在MedCalc-Env环境中微调的Qwen2.5-32B模型在MedCalc-Eval上取得了最先进的结果，在数值敏感性、公式选择和推理鲁棒性方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: MedCalc-Eval为评估LLMs的医学计算能力提供了更全面和具有挑战性的基准，MedCalc-Env环境有效提升了模型性能。但仍面临单位转换、多条件逻辑和上下文理解等挑战。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) enter the medical domain, most benchmarks
evaluate them on question answering or descriptive reasoning, overlooking
quantitative reasoning critical to clinical decision-making. Existing datasets
like MedCalc-Bench cover few calculation tasks and fail to reflect real-world
computational scenarios.
  We introduce MedCalc-Eval, the largest benchmark for assessing LLMs' medical
calculation abilities, comprising 700+ tasks across two types: equation-based
(e.g., Cockcroft-Gault, BMI, BSA) and rule-based scoring systems (e.g., Apgar,
Glasgow Coma Scale). These tasks span diverse specialties including internal
medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and cardiology, offering a broader and more
challenging evaluation setting.
  To improve performance, we further develop MedCalc-Env, a reinforcement
learning environment built on the InternBootcamp framework, enabling multi-step
clinical reasoning and planning. Fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-32B model within this
environment achieves state-of-the-art results on MedCalc-Eval, with notable
gains in numerical sensitivity, formula selection, and reasoning robustness.
Remaining challenges include unit conversion, multi-condition logic, and

TL;DR: 该研究发现多语言推理差距主要由语言理解失败引起，即模型无法将多语言输入的意义转化为主导语言（英语）。作者提出选择性翻译策略，仅在检测到理解失败时进行翻译，从而以约20%的翻译成本实现接近全翻译的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管推理语言模型在复杂推理任务上表现良好，但它们仍然存在多语言推理差距，在高资源语言中的表现优于低资源语言。现有研究虽然缩小了这一差距，但其根本原因仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 作者首先验证理解失败是多语言推理差距的主要原因，然后评估多种检测方法，发现监督方法效果最佳。基于此提出选择性翻译策略，仅在检测到理解失败时将多语言输入翻译成英语。

Result: 实验结果表明，选择性翻译能够弥合多语言推理差距，仅对约20%的输入进行翻译即可实现接近全翻译的性能。

Conclusion: 理解失败是多语言推理差距的主要根源，可以通过检测和选择性缓解来应对，这为理解其起源和实现更公平的多语言推理提供了关键见解和可行路径。

Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs) achieve strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, yet they still suffer from a multilingual reasoning gap,
performing better in high-resource languages than in low-resource ones. While
recent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely
unexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual
reasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's
inability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant
language (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to
examine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could
help mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range
of detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be
identified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we
propose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates
the multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is
detected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the
multilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while
using translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates
that understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning
gap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into
its origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型中的多种评价性判断都沿着一个主导维度——价值-同意轴（VAA）进行计算，该轴同时编码主观价值和事实主张的同意程度，揭示了推理从公正推断向目标导向论证的转变机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生物和人工智能中判断是依赖专门模块还是统一领域通用资源的核心架构问题，检验大语言模型中可解码的神经表征是否真正独立。

Method: 通过直接干预实验，在不同大语言模型中分析评价性判断的计算维度，识别并验证价值-同意轴（VAA）的存在及其功能。

Result: 发现价值-同意轴作为控制信号引导生成过程构建与其评价状态一致的论证，即使以牺牲事实准确性为代价，实现了推理从属化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了促进连贯判断的架构如何系统性地削弱忠实推理，为系统性偏见和幻觉提供了机制性解释。

Abstract: A central architectural question for both biological and artificial
intelligence is whether judgment relies on specialized modules or a unified,
domain-general resource. While the discovery of decodable neural
representations for distinct concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
suggested a modular architecture, whether these representations are truly
independent systems remains an open question. Here we provide evidence for a
convergent architecture. Across a range of LLMs, we find that diverse
evaluative judgments are computed along a dominant dimension, which we term the
Valence-Assent Axis (VAA). This axis jointly encodes subjective valence ("what
is good") and the model's assent to factual claims ("what is true"). Through
direct interventions, we show this unified representation creates a critical
dependency: the VAA functions as a control signal that steers the generative
process to construct a rationale consistent with its evaluative state, even at
the cost of factual accuracy. This mechanism, which we term the subordination
of reasoning, shifts the process of reasoning from impartial inference toward
goal-directed justification. Our discovery offers a mechanistic account for
systemic bias and hallucination, revealing how an architecture that promotes
coherent judgment can systematically undermine faithful reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出TransAlign，一种基于大规模多语言机器翻译模型编码器的新型词对齐器，在基于机器翻译的跨语言迁移中显著优于现有词对齐和非词对齐标签投影方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大多数世界语言缺乏大规模训练数据的背景下，基于翻译的跨语言迁移策略需要有效的标签投影方法。现有词对齐器主要依赖mBERT或LaBSE等编码器语言模型，而机器翻译模型在词对齐方面的潜力未被充分挖掘。

Method: TransAlign利用大规模多语言机器翻译模型的编码器来提取词对齐信息，相比传统基于交叉注意力的方法，这种方法能获得更好的词对齐性能。

Result: TransAlign不仅实现了强大的词对齐性能，在基于机器翻译的跨语言迁移任务中，显著优于流行的词对齐方法和最先进的非词对齐标签投影方法。

Conclusion: 利用大规模多语言机器翻译模型的编码器进行词对齐是一种有效的方法，能够显著提升跨语言迁移中标签投影的质量和性能。

Abstract: In the absence of sizable training data for most world languages and NLP
tasks, translation-based strategies such as translate-test -- evaluating on
noisy source language data translated from the target language -- and
translate-train -- training on noisy target language data translated from the
source language -- have been established as competitive approaches for
cross-lingual transfer (XLT). For token classification tasks, these strategies
require label projection: mapping the labels from each token in the original
sentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. To this end, it is common to
leverage multilingual word aligners (WAs) derived from encoder language models
such as mBERT or LaBSE. Despite obvious associations between machine
translation (MT) and WA, research on extracting alignments with MT models is
largely limited to exploiting cross-attention in encoder-decoder architectures,
yielding poor WA results. In this work, in contrast, we propose TransAlign, a
novel word aligner that utilizes the encoder of a massively multilingual MT
model. We show that TransAlign not only achieves strong WA performance but
substantially outperforms popular WA and state-of-the-art non-WA-based label

*Zijian Wang,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThoughtProbe是一个推理时框架，利用LLM的隐藏推理特征来指导树状响应空间探索，通过分类器评分和分支聚合方法提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要操纵隐藏表示来引导LLM生成，而本工作利用这些表示作为判别信号来指导树状响应空间探索，以提高推理性能。

Method: 在节点扩展中使用分类器作为评分和排序机制，优先处理高分候选进行延续；完成树扩展后收集所有分支答案形成候选池；提出分支聚合方法，通过聚合CoT分数在所有支持分支上进行边际化，从而确定最优答案。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架的全面探索不仅覆盖了有效推理链，还能有效识别它们，在多个算术推理基准上实现了显著改进。

Conclusion: ThoughtProbe通过利用LLM隐藏推理特征作为判别信号，结合树状空间探索和分支聚合方法，显著提升了推理性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces ThoughtProbe, a novel inference time framework that
leverages the hidden reasoning features of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
improve their reasoning performance. Unlike previous works that manipulate the
hidden representations to steer LLM generation, we harness them as
discriminative signals to guide the tree structured response space exploration.
In each node expansion, a classifier serves as a scoring and ranking mechanism
that efficiently allocates computational resources by prioritizing higher score
candidates for continuation. After completing the tree expansion, we collect
answers from all branches to form a candidate answer pool. We then propose a
branch aggregation method that marginalizes over all supporting branches by
aggregating their CoT scores, thereby identifying the optimal answer from the
pool. Experimental results show that our framework's comprehensive exploration
not only covers valid reasoning chains but also effectively identifies them,
achieving significant improvements across multiple arithmetic reasoning
benchmarks.

*Jiahao Liu,Zijian Wang,Kuo Zhao,Dong Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出IntAttn-Edit方法，通过联合更新MLP和注意力模块来改进大型语言模型的知识编辑效果，采用基于模块贡献度的知识平衡策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法主要关注MLP模块而忽略注意力模块，导致残留过时知识和编辑效果受限。研究发现注意力模块在事实知识存储中起重要作用，特别是在早期层。

Method: 提出IntAttn-Edit方法，将关联记忆范式扩展到联合更新MLP和注意力模块，采用知识平衡策略按各模块对知识存储的贡献度分配更新幅度。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，IntAttn-Edit相比先前方法实现了更高的编辑成功率、更好的泛化能力和更强的知识保留能力。平衡策略能在不同设置下保持编辑性能在最优范围内。

Conclusion: 注意力模块在知识存储中具有重要作用，联合更新MLP和注意力模块的知识编辑方法能显著提升编辑效果，知识平衡策略是保持性能稳定的关键。

Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient approach for updating factual
knowledge in large language models (LLMs). It typically locates knowledge
storage modules and then modifies their parameters. However, most existing
methods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are
often identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other
components, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing.
This imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing
effectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on
advanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual
knowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these
insights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory
paradigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a
knowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to
each module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on
standard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better
generalization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods. Further
analysis shows that the balancing strategy keeps editing performance within an
optimal range across diverse settings.

Motivation: 解决塔马齐特语在数字空间中的代表性不足问题，通过社区协作平台应对数据稀缺挑战。

Method: 建立社区驱动的协作平台awaldigital.org，让塔马齐特语使用者贡献翻译和语音数据，分析18个月的社区参与情况。

Result: 社区参与存在显著障碍，包括对书面塔马齐特语的信心不足和标准化挑战，实际数据贡献主要集中在语言学家和活动家群体，仅收集到6,421个翻译对和3小时语音数据。

Conclusion: 标准众包方法在具有复杂社会语言背景的语言中存在局限性，需要改进方法，正在利用收集的数据开发改进的开源机器翻译模型。

Abstract: This paper presents Awal, a community-powered initiative for developing
language technology resources for Tamazight. We provide a comprehensive review
of the NLP landscape for Tamazight, examining recent progress in computational
resources, and the emergence of community-driven approaches to address
persistent data scarcity. Launched in 2024, awaldigital.org platform addresses
the underrepresentation of Tamazight in digital spaces through a collaborative
platform enabling speakers to contribute translation and voice data. We analyze
18 months of community engagement, revealing significant barriers to
participation including limited confidence in written Tamazight and ongoing
standardization challenges. Despite widespread positive reception, actual data
contribution remained concentrated among linguists and activists. The modest
scale of community contributions -- 6,421 translation pairs and 3 hours of
speech data -- highlights the limitations of applying standard crowdsourcing
approaches to languages with complex sociolinguistic contexts. We are working
on improved open-source MT models using the collected data.

*Xuan Gong,Senmiao Wang,Hanbo Huang,Ruoyu Sun,Shiyu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VCORE是一种基于优化理论的重加权框架，通过方差控制的优化方法对CoT轨迹中的token进行差异化监督，提升LLM的推理泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的交叉熵损失对所有token一视同仁，忽略了推理轨迹中不同token的异质性贡献，导致监督分配不当和泛化能力弱。

Method: 将CoT监督重新表述为约束优化问题，采用优化理论视角实现token监督的自适应分配，使训练目标更符合鲁棒推理泛化的目标。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，VCORE在域内和域外设置下均显著优于现有token重加权方法，使用Qwen3系列和LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct模型验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: VCORE不仅提升了推理性能，还为后续强化学习提供了更有效的初始化，为推进LLM推理能力奠定了更强基础。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories has
emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs). However, the standard cross-entropy loss treats all
tokens equally, ignoring their heterogeneous contributions across a reasoning
trajectory. This uniform treatment leads to misallocated supervision and weak
generalization, especially in complex, long-form reasoning tasks. To address
this, we introduce \textbf{V}ariance-\textbf{C}ontrolled
\textbf{O}ptimization-based \textbf{RE}weighting (VCORE), a principled
framework that reformulates CoT supervision as a constrained optimization
problem. By adopting an optimization-theoretic perspective, VCORE enables a
principled and adaptive allocation of supervision across tokens, thereby
aligning the training objective more closely with the goal of robust reasoning
generalization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that VCORE consistently
outperforms existing token reweighting methods. Across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings, VCORE achieves substantial performance gains on
mathematical and coding benchmarks, using models from the Qwen3 series (4B, 8B,
32B) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct. Moreover, we show that VCORE serves as a more
effective initialization for subsequent reinforcement learning, establishing a
stronger foundation for advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The Code
will be released at https://github.com/coder-gx/VCORE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的协作推理框架，利用扩散语言模型生成候选思维，大语言模型评估其质量，以解决大语言模型在推理任务中计算开销过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的自回归生成范式导致推理性能随测试时间计算呈次优扩展，通常需要过多计算开销来提出思维，而仅获得边际性能提升。扩散语言模型可以通过单次前向传播并行去噪高效生成多样化样本，这启发了我们利用它们来提出中间思维，从而减轻自回归生成的计算负担。

Method: 提出高效的协作推理框架，利用扩散语言模型生成候选思维，大语言模型评估其质量。通过扩散模型并行生成多样化思维，再由语言模型进行质量筛选。

Result: 在多样化基准测试上的实验表明，该框架在复杂推理任务中实现了强大的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来研究提供了一个有前景的方向，通过结合扩散模型的高效生成能力和语言模型的质量评估能力，有效提升了推理效率。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable
advancements, with the test-time scaling law consistently enhancing the
reasoning capabilities. Through systematic evaluation and exploration of a
diverse spectrum of intermediate thoughts, LLMs demonstrate the potential to
generate deliberate reasoning steps, thereby substantially enhancing reasoning
accuracy. However, LLMs' autoregressive generation paradigm results in
reasoning performance scaling sub-optimally with test-time computation, often
requiring excessive computational overhead to propose thoughts while yielding
only marginal performance gains. In contrast, diffusion language models (DLMs)
can efficiently produce diverse samples through parallel denoising in a single
forward pass, inspiring us to leverage them for proposing intermediate
thoughts, thereby alleviating the computational burden associated with
autoregressive generation while maintaining quality. In this work, we propose
an efficient collaborative reasoning framework, leveraging DLMs to generate
candidate thoughts and LLMs to evaluate their quality. Experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance
in complex reasoning tasks, offering a promising direction for future research.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了静态词向量（GloVe）和上下文嵌入（BERT）在英语复合词处理中与人类语义判断的一致性，发现BERT在捕捉组合语义方面优于GloVe，可预测性评级是语义透明度的强预测因子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究计算嵌入与人类语义判断在处理英语复合词时的一致性，推进计算心理语言学发展。

Method: 使用关联强度、频率和可预测性度量，计算嵌入衍生的LMD和ST指标，通过Spearman相关和回归分析评估其与人类判断的关系。

Result: BERT嵌入比GloVe更好地捕捉组合语义，可预测性评级在人类和模型数据中都是语义透明度的强预测因子。

Conclusion: 研究阐明了驱动复合词处理的因素，并为基于嵌入的语义建模提供了见解。

Abstract: This study investigates how well computational embeddings align with human
semantic judgments in the processing of English compound words. We compare
static word vectors (GloVe) and contextualized embeddings (BERT) against human
ratings of lexeme meaning dominance (LMD) and semantic transparency (ST) drawn
from a psycholinguistic dataset. Using measures of association strength
(Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus), frequency (BNC), and predictability (LaDEC),
we compute embedding-derived LMD and ST metrics and assess their relationships
with human judgments via Spearmans correlation and regression analyses. Our
results show that BERT embeddings better capture compositional semantics than
GloVe, and that predictability ratings are strong predictors of semantic
transparency in both human and model data. These findings advance computational
psycholinguistics by clarifying the factors that drive compound word processing
and offering insights into embedding-based semantic modeling.

TL;DR: 该研究在低资源自然语言任务中比较了两种因果域泛化方法：因果数据增强和不变因果表示学习，证明它们都能提高模型在未见域上的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习模型在真实场景中因分布偏移导致的泛化问题，特别是在低资源设置下数据稀缺和领域多样性有限的情况。

Method: 1. 因果数据增强方法：自动生成反事实样本来改善对伪相关的鲁棒性，应用于NaijaSenti Twitter语料库的情感分类；2. 不变因果表示学习方法：使用DINER框架，将其适配到多语言设置中。

Result: 两种方法都增强了未见域的鲁棒性：反事实数据增强在情感分类中带来一致的跨域准确率提升；DINER因果表示学习改善了多语言情感分析中的分布外性能，但在不同语言间收益不同。

Conclusion: 因果域泛化方法在低资源自然语言任务中有效，能提高模型对分布偏移的鲁棒性，但不同方法的适用性和效果可能因具体任务和语言而异。

Abstract: Machine learning models typically assume that training and test data follow
the same distribution, an assumption that often fails in real-world scenarios
due to distribution shifts. This issue is especially pronounced in low-resource
settings, where data scarcity and limited domain diversity hinder robust
generalization. Domain generalization (DG) approaches address this challenge by
learning features that remain invariant across domains, often using causal
mechanisms to improve model robustness. In this study, we examine two distinct
causal DG techniques in low-resource natural language tasks. First, we
investigate a causal data augmentation (CDA) approach that automatically
generates counterfactual examples to improve robustness to spurious
correlations. We apply this method to sentiment classification on the
NaijaSenti Twitter corpus, expanding the training data with semantically
equivalent paraphrases to simulate controlled distribution shifts. Second, we
explore an invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) approach using the
DINER framework, originally proposed for debiasing aspect-based sentiment
analysis. We adapt DINER to a multilingual setting. Our findings demonstrate
that both approaches enhance robustness to unseen domains: counterfactual data
augmentation yields consistent cross-domain accuracy gains in sentiment
classification, while causal representation learning with DINER improves
out-of-distribution performance in multilingual sentiment analysis, albeit with
varying gains across languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiSparse-AAS是一个结合稀疏注意力、自适应跨度与双线性注意力的新型框架，用于解决Transformer在长文档摘要中的二次复杂度问题，在多个数据集上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构在文本摘要中表现出色，但其二次计算复杂度限制了在长文档上的可扩展性，需要更高效的注意力机制。

Method: 提出BiSparse-AAS框架，结合稀疏注意力（降低计算成本）、自适应跨度（动态调整注意力范围）和双线性注意力（建模复杂token交互）。

Result: 在CNN/DailyMail和XSum数据集上分别实现平均68.1%和52.6%的ROUGE提升，在OpenWebText和Gigaword数据集上保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: BiSparse-AAS通过解决效率、可扩展性和长序列建模问题，为实际文本摘要应用提供了统一实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have advanced text summarization, yet their
quadratic complexity limits scalability on long documents. This paper
introduces BiSparse-AAS (Bilinear Sparse Attention with Adaptive Spans), a
novel framework that combines sparse attention, adaptive spans, and bilinear
attention to address these limitations. Sparse attention reduces computational
costs by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input, while adaptive spans
dynamically adjust the attention ranges. Bilinear attention complements both by
modeling complex token interactions within this refined context. BiSparse-AAS
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extractive and
abstractive summarization tasks, achieving average ROUGE improvements of about
68.1% on CNN/DailyMail and 52.6% on XSum, while maintaining strong performance
on OpenWebText and Gigaword datasets. By addressing efficiency, scalability,
and long-sequence modeling, BiSparse-AAS provides a unified, practical solution
for real-world text summarization applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SQLSpace是一种人类可解释、可泛化、紧凑的文本到SQL示例表示方法，通过最小人工干预获得。它支持三种应用：比较文本到SQL基准测试的组成差异、细粒度理解模型性能、通过针对性查询重写提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到SQL评估主要依赖原始示例和总体准确率，难以深入分析模型性能模式和基准测试的组成差异，需要一种更结构化的表示方法来支持细粒度分析。

Method: 开发SQLSpace表示方法，从文本到SQL示例中提取人类可解释的特征表示，支持基准测试对比分析、模型性能细粒度评估和基于正确性估计的查询重写。

Result: SQLSpace能够揭示基准测试之间的组成差异，暴露被总体准确率掩盖的性能模式，支持查询成功建模，并实现通过针对性重写提升模型性能。

Conclusion: SQLSpace为文本到SQL任务提供了有效的分析工具，能够支持更深入的性能理解和模型改进，超越了传统基于原始示例和总体准确率的评估方法。

Abstract: We introduce SQLSpace, a human-interpretable, generalizable, compact
representation for text-to-SQL examples derived with minimal human
intervention. We demonstrate the utility of these representations in evaluation
with three use cases: (i) closely comparing and contrasting the composition of
popular text-to-SQL benchmarks to identify unique dimensions of examples they
evaluate, (ii) understanding model performance at a granular level beyond
overall accuracy scores, and (iii) improving model performance through targeted
query rewriting based on learned correctness estimation. We show that SQLSpace
enables analysis that would be difficult with raw examples alone: it reveals
compositional differences between benchmarks, exposes performance patterns
obscured by accuracy alone, and supports modeling of query success.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了患者中心摘要（PCS）的新标准，旨在生成包含患者价值观的临床摘要，并评估开源大语言模型在此任务上的表现。研究发现患者强调生活方式、社会支持等要素，而临床医生需要简洁的功能、心理和情感背景信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM生成的临床摘要主要关注患者生物学信息，而忽略了患者的偏好、价值观、愿望和关切，无法实现真正的以患者为中心的护理。

Method: 采用混合方法：通过患者和临床医生的半结构化访谈确定PCS内容框架，制定标注指南，由临床医生创建88份房颤咨询的黄金标准PCS。使用5个开源LLM进行零样本和少样本提示生成摘要，并通过ROUGE-L、BERTScore和定性指标进行评估。

Result: 最佳零样本性能由Mistral-8B（ROUGE-L 0.189）和Llama-3.1-8B（BERTScore 0.673）实现；最佳少样本性能由Llama-3.1-8B（ROUGE-L 0.206，BERTScore 0.683）实现。完整性和流畅性方面模型与专家相似，但正确性和患者中心性方面人类PCS更优。

Conclusion: 开源LLM在生成患者中心临床摘要方面显示出潜力，但在正确性和患者中心性方面仍需改进。PCS框架为AI临床摘要任务提供了新的标准，有助于实现真正的以患者为中心的护理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating the potential to
reach human-level performance in generating clinical summaries from
patient-clinician conversations. However, these summaries often focus on
patients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns.
To achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries
(PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture
patient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current
open-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a
mixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients
and 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured
interviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be
included in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical
use. Findings informed annotation guidelines used by eight clinicians to create
gold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultations. Sixteen
consultations were used to refine a prompt aligned with the guidelines. Five
open-source LLMs (Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-8B, Gemma-3-4B, and
Qwen3-8B) generated summaries for 72 consultations using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, evaluated with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics. Patients
emphasized lifestyle routines, social support, recent stressors, and care
values. Clinicians sought concise functional, psychosocial, and emotional
context. The best zero-shot performance was achieved by Mistral-8B (ROUGE-L
0.189) and Llama-3.1-8B (BERTScore 0.673); the best few-shot by Llama-3.1-8B
(ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683). Completeness and fluency were similar between
experts and models, while correctness and patient-centeredness favored human
PCS.

TL;DR: DialectalArabicMMLU是一个新的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在阿拉伯语方言上的表现，通过手动翻译和改编3K个多选题对到五种主要方言，总共包含15K个问答对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的阿拉伯语和多语言基准测试主要集中在现代标准阿拉伯语，而方言变体在日常交流中普遍使用但代表性不足，因此需要开发专门评估方言理解能力的基准。

Method: 基于MMLU-Redux框架，通过人工翻译和改编3K个多选题对到五种主要阿拉伯语方言（叙利亚、埃及、阿联酋、沙特和摩洛哥），涵盖32个学术和专业领域。

Result: 评估了19个开源阿拉伯语和多语言LLM（1B-13B参数），发现不同方言间存在显著的性能差异，揭示了方言泛化能力的持续差距。

Conclusion: DialectalArabicMMLU提供了首个统一的人工策划资源，用于衡量阿拉伯语方言理解能力，从而促进更具包容性的评估和未来模型开发。

Abstract: We present DialectalArabicMMLU, a new benchmark for evaluating the
performance of large language models (LLMs) across Arabic dialects. While
recently developed Arabic and multilingual benchmarks have advanced LLM
evaluation for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal varieties remain
underrepresented despite their prevalence in everyday communication.
DialectalArabicMMLU extends the MMLU-Redux framework through manual translation
and adaptation of 3K multiple-choice question-answer pairs into five major
dialects (Syrian, Egyptian, Emirati, Saudi, and Moroccan), yielding a total of
15K QA pairs across 32 academic and professional domains (22K QA pairs when
also including English and MSA). The benchmark enables systematic assessment of
LLM reasoning and comprehension beyond MSA, supporting both task-based and
linguistic analysis. We evaluate 19 open-weight Arabic and multilingual LLMs
(1B-13B parameters) and report substantial performance variation across
dialects, revealing persistent gaps in dialectal generalization.
DialectalArabicMMLU provides the first unified, human-curated resource for
measuring dialectal understanding in Arabic, thus promoting more inclusive
evaluation and future model development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗应用中，低资源语言的领域特定NLP工具稀缺，多语言BERT虽能缓解语言差距，但医疗NLP任务在低资源语言中仍未被充分探索。

Method: 进行了四个实验来创建医学领域模型，包括在领域特定语料上进一步预训练，然后在三个下游任务上微调：荷兰语临床笔记的患者自动筛查、罗马尼亚语和西班牙语临床笔记的命名实体识别。

Result: 领域适应显著提升了任务性能，临床领域适应模型优于更一般的生物医学领域适应模型，并观察到跨语言可转移性的证据。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了领域适应和跨语言能力在医疗NLP中的可行性，为开发多语言医疗NLP系统以缓解训练数据不足提供了有意义的指导。

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare applications, the availability of domain-specific
natural language processing(NLP) tools is limited, especially for low-resource
languages. Although multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from
transformers (BERT) offers a promising motivation to mitigate the language gap,
the medical NLP tasks in low-resource languages are still underexplored.
Therefore, this study investigates how further pre-training on domain-specific
corpora affects model performance on medical tasks, focusing on three
languages: Dutch, Romanian and Spanish. In terms of further pre-training, we
conducted four experiments to create medical domain models. Then, these models
were fine-tuned on three downstream tasks: Automated patient screening in Dutch
clinical notes, named entity recognition in Romanian and Spanish clinical
notes. Results show that domain adaptation significantly enhanced task
performance. Furthermore, further differentiation of domains, e.g. clinical and
general biomedical domains, resulted in diverse performances. The clinical
domain-adapted model outperformed the more general biomedical domain-adapted
model. Moreover, we observed evidence of cross-lingual transferability.
Moreover, we also conducted further investigations to explore potential reasons
contributing to these performance differences. These findings highlight the
feasibility of domain adaptation and cross-lingual ability in medical NLP.
Within the low-resource language settings, these findings can provide
meaningful guidance for developing multilingual medical NLP systems to mitigate
the lack of training data and thereby improve the model performance.

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLMs often require adaptation to domain-specific requirements, a process that
can be expensive when relying solely on SFT. We present an empirical study on
applying CPO to simulate a post-editing workflow for data-efficient domain
adaptation. Our approach synthesizes preference pairs by treating the base
model's own raw output as the 'rejected' translation and the human-approved TM
entry as the 'chosen' one. This method provides direct feedback on the model's
current knowledge, guiding it to align with domain-specific standards.
Experiments in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean show that, by
using just 14.7k preference pairs, the model achieves performance close to that
of a model trained on 160k+ samples with SFT, demonstrating significant data
efficiency. Although we showcase its effectiveness in MT, this application of
CPO naturally generalizes to other generative tasks where a model's initial
drafts can serve as a contrastive signal against a golden reference.

Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by grounding LLMs in external knowledge;
However, the effectiveness of RAG critically depends on whether the model can
adequately access relevant information. Existing RAG systems rely on a single
retriever with fixed top-k selection, restricting access to a narrow and static
subset of the corpus. As a result, this single-retriever paradigm has become
the primary bottleneck for comprehensive external information acquisition,
especially in tasks requiring corpus-level reasoning. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MARAG-R1, a reinforcement-learned multi-tool RAG
framework that enables LLMs to dynamically coordinate multiple retrieval
mechanisms for broader and more precise information access. MARAG-R1 equips the
model with four retrieval tools -- semantic search, keyword search, filtering,
and aggregation -- and learns both how and when to use them through a two-stage
training process: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning.
This design allows the model to interleave reasoning and retrieval,
progressively gathering sufficient evidence for corpus-level synthesis.
Experiments on GlobalQA, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that
MARAG-R1 substantially outperforms strong baselines and achieves new
state-of-the-art results in corpus-level reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 大语言模型在推理时面临计算瓶颈，特别是随着上下文长度增加，自注意力机制的二次复杂度成为主要问题。需要在不牺牲输出质量的前提下减少冗余计算。

Method: 使用KL散度进行草稿模型和目标模型的层对齐；GPU优化的无排序top-p token选择算法；基于预测的动态键值缓存剪枝。

Result: 在PG-19数据集上实现了超过75%的KV缓存访问减少，仅增加15.29%的困惑度，显著优于现有稀疏注意力方法。

Conclusion: 推测执行可以通过近似验证来增强，而不会导致显著的性能下降，为高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational bottlenecks
during inference due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms,
particularly as context lengths increase. We introduce SpecAttn, a novel
training-free approach that seamlessly integrates with existing speculative
decoding techniques to enable efficient sparse attention in pre-trained
transformers. Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already
computed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important
tokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while
maintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL
divergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a
GPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft
attention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these
predictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard
speculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in
key-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19
dataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods. Our
approach demonstrates that speculative execution can be enhanced to provide
approximate verification without significant performance degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的效率受到逐token顺序生成过程的根本限制，需要新的设计维度来突破这一瓶颈，即增加每个生成步骤的语义带宽。

Method: 使用高保真自动编码器将K个token压缩为单个连续向量，将语言建模为连续向量序列而非离散token序列，并开发了无似然框架来支持连续域的训练、评估和可控采样。

Result: CALM显著改善了性能-计算权衡，在显著降低计算成本的情况下达到了强离散基线的性能水平。

Conclusion: 下一个向量预测是构建超高效语言模型的一个强大且可扩展的途径。

Abstract: The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by
their sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming
this bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the
semantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce
Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from
discrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses
a high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single
continuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with
over 99.9\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of
continuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of
generative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new
modeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free
framework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling
in the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the
performance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete
baselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these
findings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway
towards ultra-efficient language models. Code:
