The\nmethod builds a hierarchical memory structure that divides knowledge\nrepresentations into different levels of granularity, enabling dynamic indexing\nand retrieval from local details to global context, and thus establishing\ncloser semantic connections between retrieval and generation. On this basis, an\nuncertainty estimation mechanism is introduced to explicitly constrain and\nfilter low-confidence paths during the generation process, allowing the model\nto maintain information coverage while effectively suppressing noise and false\ncontent. The overall optimization objective consists of generation loss,\nentropy constraints, and variance regularization, forming a unified confidence\ncontrol framework. In the experiments, comprehensive sensitivity tests and\ncomparative analyses were designed, covering hyperparameters, environmental\nconditions, and data structures, to verify the stability and robustness of the\nproposed method across different scenarios. The results show that the method\nachieves superior performance over existing models in QA accuracy, retrieval\nrecall, ranking quality, and factual consistency, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of combining multi-granularity indexing with confidence control.\nThis study not only provides a new technical pathway for retrieval-augmented\ngeneration but also offers practical evidence for improving the reliability and\ncontrollability of large models in complex contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u77e5\u8bc6\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u77e5\u8bc6\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ed3\u6784\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001\u6392\u5e8f\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7d22\u5f15\u4e0e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3a\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

This setup confronts not\nonly the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but\nalso distinct challenges posed by interaction drift and detecting zero-shot HOI\ncombinations with sequentially arriving data. Therefore, we propose a novel\nexemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework.

Extensive experiments on HICO-DET\nand V-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over\nstate-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness\nagainst interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs.

The\noverall framework consists of distillation loss, robustness loss, and a\nregularization term, forming a unified optimization objective that balances\nalignment ability with resistance to interference. To systematically validate\nits effectiveness, the study designs experiments from multiple perspectives,\nincluding distillation weight sensitivity, stability analysis under computation\nbudgets and mixed-precision environments, and the impact of data noise and\ndistribution shifts on model performance.

While most\nrecent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing\n3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for\nmany real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and\nforest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of\na comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over\nreal-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have\nbuilt a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM\nin wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric\nDreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect\naerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of\nadditional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also\nprovides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and\ntypes and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks\ncovering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting\npilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images\nfrom a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2.

Existing methods aim to capture spatial dependencies of\nquery objects between different views through attention mechanisms to obtain\nspatial relationship feature maps, which are then used to predict object\nlocations. Although promising, these approaches fail to effectively transfer\ninformation between views and do not further refine the spatial relationship\nfeature maps. This results in the model erroneously focusing on irrelevant edge\nnoise, thereby affecting localization performance. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM),\nwhich performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views,\nenabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the\nquery object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of\ncross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the\nquery object. Furthermore, we integrate a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module\n(MHSAM), which employs convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract\nmulti-scale spatial features from the feature maps containing implicit\ncorrespondences, further enhancing the feature representation of the query\nobject.

This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these\nchallenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating\nlong (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations,\naccompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities.\nFrom this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and\n2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose\nLIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three\ncomplementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working\nmemory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts.

Existing approaches see CNNs excel at modeling local\ntextures, while Transformers excel at capturing global context. However,\nefficiently integrating them remains a bottleneck due to the high computational\ncost of Transformers. To tackle this, we propose AFM-Net, a novel Advanced\nHierarchical Fusing framework that achieves effective local and global\nco-representation through two pathways: a CNN branch for extracting\nhierarchical visual priors, and a Mamba branch for efficient global sequence\nmodeling. The core innovation of AFM-Net lies in its Hierarchical Fusion\nMechanism, which progressively aggregates multi-scale features from both\npathways, enabling dynamic cross-level feature interaction and contextual\nreconstruction to produce highly discriminative representations. These fused\nfeatures are then adaptively routed through a Mixture-of-Experts classifier\nmodule, which dispatches them to the most suitable experts for fine-grained\nscene recognition. Experiments on AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and UC Merced show that\nAFM-Net obtains 93.72, 95.54, and 96.92 percent accuracy, surpassing\nstate-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency.

In this study, we explore the feasibility of approximating Banff\nlesion scores using existing deep learning models through a modular, rule-based\nframework. We decompose each Banff indicator - such as glomerulitis (g),\nperitubular capillaritis (ptc), and intimal arteritis (v) - into its\nconstituent structural and inflammatory components, and assess whether current\nsegmentation and detection tools can support their computation. Model outputs\nare mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert\nguidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths.

The\nLLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key\nobjects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly\ndetected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,\nregion-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated.

While\nrecent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual\nreasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's\ninability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant\nlanguage (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to\nexamine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could\nhelp mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range\nof detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be\nidentified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we\npropose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates\nthe multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is\ndetected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the\nmultilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while\nusing translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates\nthat understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning\ngap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into\nits origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.\nOur code and data are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/deokhk/RLM_analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u5931\u8d25\u5f15\u8d77\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c06\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u82f1\u8bed\uff09\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7406\u89e3\u5931\u8d25\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ee5\u7ea620%\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u867d\u7136\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u4ecd\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u5148\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u89e3\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7406\u89e3\u5931\u8d25\u65f6\u5c06\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u5165\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u82f1\u8bed\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7ffb\u8bd1\u80fd\u591f\u5f25\u5408\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u7ea620%\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u89e3\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7f13\u89e3\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u8d77\u6e90\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Fusing the\nthese complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D\nperception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to\nsingle-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete\nscene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,\nhinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers\nricher spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust\nand effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and\nmitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.\nConsequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object\ndetection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal\ndata from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate\nfeatures from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce\nreference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer\ninformation for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level\ninter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align\nglobal features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature\naggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories\nto enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then\nprocessed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to\nencode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation.

Through\ndirect interventions, we show this unified representation creates a critical\ndependency: the VAA functions as a control signal that steers the generative\nprocess to construct a rationale consistent with its evaluative state, even at\nthe cost of factual accuracy.

Besides static images, more and more research attentions have\nbeen drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only\nhas a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in\nensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks,\nhuman-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to\ngenerate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via\nCondition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic\nsingle-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion\nmodel. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a\nvideo sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully\nbenefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance\nEnhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image\nduring the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering\nModule (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains.

While existing caching techniques can\naccelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed\nand fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational\noverhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel\nhierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model\narchitectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising\nprocess can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a\ndetail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold\nsystem, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure\nthe efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature\nsummarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity\nestimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that\nH2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining\nimage quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and\nqualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a\nrobust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality\ndilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of\nhigh-fidelity diffusion models.

It typically locates knowledge\nstorage modules and then modifies their parameters. However, most existing\nmethods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are\noften identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other\ncomponents, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing.\nThis imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing\neffectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on\nadvanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual\nknowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these\ninsights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory\nparadigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a\nknowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to\neach module's measured contribution to knowledge storage.

We provide a comprehensive review\nof the NLP landscape for Tamazight, examining recent progress in computational\nresources, and the emergence of community-driven approaches to address\npersistent data scarcity. Launched in 2024, awaldigital.org platform addresses\nthe underrepresentation of Tamazight in digital spaces through a collaborative\nplatform enabling speakers to contribute translation and voice data. We analyze\n18 months of community engagement, revealing significant barriers to\nparticipation including limited confidence in written Tamazight and ongoing\nstandardization challenges.

Achieving a robust\nand highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,\nmainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately\nannotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare\nenvironments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from\ndifferences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical\npurposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past\ndata, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our\napproach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship\nbetween previously learned knowledge and new information across different\ntraining stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.\nSpecifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our\nmethod mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual\npretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature\ndistillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge\ndistillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of\nthe model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations.

In this study, we examine two distinct\ncausal DG techniques in low-resource natural language tasks.

Second, we\nexplore an invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) approach using the\nDINER framework, originally proposed for debiasing aspect-based sentiment\nanalysis. We adapt DINER to a multilingual setting.

However, these summaries often focus on\npatients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns.\nTo achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries\n(PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture\npatient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current\nopen-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a\nmixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients\nand 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured\ninterviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be\nincluded in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical\nuse. Findings informed annotation guidelines used by eight clinicians to create\ngold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultations. Sixteen\nconsultations were used to refine a prompt aligned with the guidelines. Five\nopen-source LLMs (Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-8B, Gemma-3-4B, and\nQwen3-8B) generated summaries for 72 consultations using zero-shot and few-shot\nprompting, evaluated with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics. Patients\nemphasized lifestyle routines, social support, recent stressors, and care\nvalues. Clinicians sought concise functional, psychosocial, and emotional\ncontext. The best zero-shot performance was achieved by Mistral-8B (ROUGE-L\n0.189) and Llama-3.1-8B (BERTScore 0.673); the best few-shot by Llama-3.1-8B\n(ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683).

We evaluate 19 open-weight Arabic and multilingual LLMs\n(1B-13B parameters) and report substantial performance variation across\ndialects, revealing persistent gaps in dialectal generalization.\nDialectalArabicMMLU provides the first unified, human-curated resource for\nmeasuring dialectal understanding in Arabic, thus promoting more inclusive\nevaluation and future model development.", "AI": {"tldr": "DialectalArabicMMLU\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u65b9\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u52a8\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u6539\u7f163K\u4e2a\u591a\u9009\u9898\u5bf9\u5230\u4e94\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u8a00\uff0c\u603b\u5171\u5305\u542b15K\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\uff0c\u800c\u65b9\u8a00\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u65e5\u5e38\u4ea4\u6d41\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u4f7f\u7528\u4f46\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMMLU-Redux\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u6539\u7f163K\u4e2a\u591a\u9009\u9898\u5bf9\u5230\u4e94\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u65b9\u8a00\uff08\u53d9\u5229\u4e9a\u3001\u57c3\u53ca\u3001\u963f\u8054\u914b\u3001\u6c99\u7279\u548c\u6469\u6d1b\u54e5\uff09\uff0c\u6db5\u76d632\u4e2a\u5b66\u672f\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8619\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\uff081B-13B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u8a00\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65b9\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "DialectalArabicMMLU\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u7b56\u5212\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u65b9\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u5177\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

MARAG-R1 equips the\nmodel with four retrieval tools -- semantic search, keyword search, filtering,\nand aggregation -- and learns both how and when to use them through a two-stage\ntraining process: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning.\nThis design allows the model to interleave reasoning and retrieval,\nprogressively gathering sufficient evidence for corpus-level synthesis.\nExperiments on GlobalQA, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that\nMARAG-R1 substantially outperforms strong baselines and achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results in corpus-level reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MARAG-R1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u5de5\u5177RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5355\u4e00\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u8bbf\u95ee\u4fe1\u606f\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684top-k\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMARAG-R1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u56db\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u805a\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03+\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u5982\u4f55\u548c\u4f55\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u4ea4\u9519\u8fdb\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728GlobalQA\u3001HotpotQA\u548c2WikiMultiHopQA\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMARAG-R1\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "MARAG-R1\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5de5\u5177\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbf\u95ee\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing model-merging techniques,\ndesigned for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to\ndeliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static\ninterpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we\nintroduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free\nframework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the\nJensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3\ndynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to\ngeneralist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of\nsample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that\ncomputes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing\ncomputational bottleneck.

As a\nnovel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial\ntraining to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood\nof sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of\nadversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this\nwork, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of\nconcept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept\nspace? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual\nsemantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting\nof concept spaces.

Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art\nmethods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM\nunlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure\nperformance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training\ntime by 90%.

To deal with complex editing instructions, they often need to jointly\nfine-tune the large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), which\ninvolves very high computational complexity and training cost. To address this\nissue, we propose a new method, called \\textbf{C}omplex \\textbf{I}mage\n\\textbf{E}diting via \\textbf{L}LM \\textbf{R}easoning (CIELR), which converts a\ncomplex user instruction into a set of simple and explicit editing actions,\neliminating the need for jointly fine-tuning the large language models and\ndiffusion models. Specifically, we first construct a structured semantic\nrepresentation of the input image using foundation models. Then, we introduce\nan iterative update mechanism that can progressively refine this\nrepresentation, obtaining a fine-grained visual representation of the image\nscene. This allows us to perform complex and flexible image editing tasks.\nExtensive experiments on the SmartEdit Reasoning Scenario Set show that our\nmethod surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR, indicating\nits superior preservation of regions that should remain consistent. Due to the\nlimited number of samples of public datasets of complex image editing with\nreasoning, we construct a benchmark named CIEBench, containing 86 image\nsamples, together with a metric specifically for reasoning-based image editing.\nCIELR also outperforms previous methods on this benchmark.

However, existing methods\nextract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a\nsingle feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address\nthis, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns\ntree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities.\nSpecifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework\nthat applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from\nintermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual\nfeatures with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the\ntwo modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to\neffectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the\nheterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL\ndistance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an\nintermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance.

Existing methods treat every annotated text-video\npair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic\nvariation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently,\nembeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for\ndistinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of\nsemantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven\napart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse\nevents. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic\ncollapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text\nCorrelation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships\nencoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in\nvideo embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive\nalignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across\ntemporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and\nadaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are\ninternally coherent yet mutually distinctive.

However, current generative models have two major\nlimitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking\nsemantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange\nindependent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation\nmethods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users\ninto the cumbersome cycle of \"writing-compiling-reviewing\" and lack the\nintuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet\nthe needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in\nscientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent\nframework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol.\nVisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a\nToolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector\ngraphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be\nexplicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and\nany element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the\nquality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with\nseven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density\nscientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception,\nand interaction cost.

The first tier identifies\npotential gaps and \"mislabelled\" schools.

The\nmedium-resolution approach was later removed due to insignificant improvements.\nThe medium and VHR resolution models build upon global pre-trained steps to\nimprove generalisation. A key component of the proposed approach is an\ninteractive interface to allow human operators to iteratively review, validate,\nand refine the mapping results.

Data and models are available at\n  https://github.com/H-EmbodVis/NAUTILUS", "summary": "Underwater exploration offers critical insights into our planet and attracts\nincreasing attention for its broader applications in resource exploration,\nnational security, etc. We study the underwater scene understanding methods,\nwhich aim to achieve automated underwater exploration. The underwater scene\nunderstanding task demands multi-task perceptions from multiple granularities.\nHowever, the absence of large-scale underwater multi-task instruction-tuning\ndatasets hinders the progress of this research. To bridge this gap, we\nconstruct NautData, a dataset containing 1.45 M image-text pairs supporting\neight underwater scene understanding tasks. It enables the development and\nthorough evaluation of the underwater scene understanding models. Underwater\nimage degradation is a widely recognized challenge that interferes with\nunderwater tasks. To improve the robustness of underwater scene understanding,\nwe introduce physical priors derived from underwater imaging models and propose\na plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module, which explicitly\nrestores clear underwater information. We integrate this module into renowned\nbaselines LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL and build our underwater LMM, NAUTILUS.\nExperiments conducted on the NautData and public underwater datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the VFE module, consistently improving the\nperformance of both baselines on the majority of supported tasks, thus ensuring\nthe superiority of NAUTILUS in the underwater scene understanding area.

However, automated analysis of\nhistorical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide\nstylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing\nlinked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more\ntime-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information\nfrom multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating\nbuildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying\nenvironmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for\nautomatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a\nvisual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with\nfew-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images\nand time series as videos.

However, it remains\nchallenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences\nbecause of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,\nwe propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework\nthat handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across\ndiverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer\narchitecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still\nenabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent\nnoise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This\ndesign enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional\nmanner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the\ndecoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling\nmethod that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve\nasynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks\nsuch as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods,\nwhile our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On\nreal-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by\n13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation.

While\nrecent research has explored ways to incorporate user constraints to guide the\nlayout generation, these constraints often require complex specifications which\nreduce usability. We introduce an innovative approach exploiting user-provided\nsketches as intuitive constraints and we demonstrate empirically the\neffectiveness of this new guidance method, establishing the sketch-to-layout\nproblem as a promising research direction, which is currently under-explored.\nTo tackle the sketch-to-layout problem, we propose a multimodal\ntransformer-based solution using the sketch and the content assets as inputs to\nproduce high quality layouts. Since collecting sketch training data from human\nannotators to train our model is very costly, we introduce a novel and\nefficient method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale.

Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the\nmost commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a\nsimilarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of\ntheir sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent\nstudies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for\nmeasuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we\nhave observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which\nnegatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when\nused as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes\nleads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).\nThrough analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD\nnot only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,\nwhich enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the\nAI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box\nregression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across various detectors.

Collectively, these results establish deep\ndenoising as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances\nquantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited\ntechniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u91cf\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u64cd\u4f5c\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u529f\u80fd\u6750\u6599\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5316\u5b66\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u53bb\u566a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PDE\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u626b\u63cf\u900f\u5c04X\u5c04\u7ebf\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u3001\u5149\u5b66\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u548c\u4e2d\u5b50\u5c04\u7ebf\u7167\u76f8\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5e94\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u53bb\u566a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u6700\u5c0f\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u53bb\u566a\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9502\u94c1\u78f7\u9178\u76d0\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ea7\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u77f3\u58a8\u7535\u6781\u4e2d\u9897\u7c92\u5206\u5272\u548c\u76f8\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4e2d\u5b50\u5c04\u7ebf\u7167\u76f8\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u8bf1\u5bfc\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8fd180%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u53bb\u566a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u3001\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u9650\u5236\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

However,\nlimited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex\ngenerative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video\ngeneration. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory\nusage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.\nWhile prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential\nsolution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of\nmulti-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step\ncounterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step\ndistillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model\ncapacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution\nmatching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the\nSNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR\nlevels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training\nobjective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous\nmathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art\nimage and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and\nWan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD\npreserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative\ncapabilities. We will release our code and models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Phased DMD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6b65\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DMD\u5728\u590d\u6742\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3DMD\u5728\u590d\u6742\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u591a\u6b65\u84b8\u998f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6548\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPhased DMD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u601d\u60f3\uff1a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5b50\u533a\u95f4\u5185\u7684\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u3002\u5c06SNR\u8303\u56f4\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5b50\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u7ec6\u5316\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8SNR\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u84b8\u998f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ecQwen-Image\u548cWan2.2\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cPhased DMD\u6bd4DMD\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Phased DMD\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6b65\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
